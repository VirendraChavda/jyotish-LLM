- Namaste. From your birth details and current planetary periods, you are presently in the Jupiter Mahadasha and Venus Antardasha. Jupiter and Venus both are auspicious for marriage, especially Venus which governs relationships and love. Your Navamsa chart shows favorable placements supporting marriage prospects, but the transit of Saturn in your 9th house and Moon's current transit may be causing delays or misunderstandings in relationships.

The upcoming favorable period for marriage is when Venus transits your 1st or 7th house, and Jupiter's influence strengthens further, which will be around late 2025 to early 2026. Also, the Graha Maitri and Yoni compatibility should be checked with prospective matches for better harmony. Meanwhile, you may perform remedies like offering yellow flowers to Lord Vishnu on Fridays and chanting the Venus mantra "Om Shukraya Namaha" to enhance Venus's positive effects. Patience and self-improvement during this period will attract the right partner.

Thus, considering your Rasi, Navamsa, current Mahadasha/Antardasha, and transits, marriage is likely to happen in the next 1 to 1.5 years with the right match. Keep faith and continue your efforts with these astrological insights in mind.
