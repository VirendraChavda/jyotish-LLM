- You are currently running Jupiter Mahadasha and Venus Antardasha, both natural benefics for marriage and relationships, which is a favorable period for marriage prospects. However, Venus is placed in the 7th house from your ascendant in the natal chart, indicating strong desire for partnership but also some delays or selectiveness in marriage. The upcoming transit of Jupiter and Venus through your 7th house from 16-01-2026 to around mid-2027 will activate marriage-related matters positively. Additionally, the Moonâ€™s transit into your 7th house around 20-01-2026 to 19-02-2026 may bring emotional readiness and opportunities for commitment.

The current planetary periods and transits suggest that the best window for marriage is between January 2026 and mid-2027, when both Jupiter and Venus support your 7th house affairs. Until then, it is advisable to remain patient and focus on self-improvement and social interactions. Remedies like chanting Venus and Jupiter mantras, offering water to Peepal tree on Fridays, and wearing a natural pearl or diamond after consulting a qualified astrologer may help enhance marital prospects.

2. gpt-4o-mini
- I understand your concern regarding marriage and the challenges you are facing in finding a suitable match. Based on your current planetary period, you are in the Mahadasha of Jupiter and the Antardasha of Venus, which is generally favorable for relationships and marriage. This period will last until 30-09-2031, providing a good window for potential matches.

However, looking at your Rasi chart and current influences, it appears that there may be some underlying factors affecting your romantic prospects. The influence of Venus in your chart suggests that while you may attract attention, compatibility issues could arise due to the positions of other planets. To enhance your chances of finding a suitable partner, consider engaging in activities that promote social interactions and seek guidance from a trusted astrologer for personalized remedies, such as wearing gemstones or performing specific rituals during this favorable period.

- I understand you are facing difficulties in finding a suitable marriage partner. Based on your birth chart and current planetary transits, your current Mahadasha is Jupiter, and the Antardasha is Venus. This period, particularly from approximately 2023 to 2026, indicates a time when relationships and marriage are highlighted. However, the transit of Saturn into your 9th house from 2025 onwards, and its aspect on your 1st and 5th houses, may be contributing to delays or challenges in finding a compatible match.

To improve your prospects, consider focusing on developing patience and understanding during this phase. The transit of Venus through your 12th house currently, and its upcoming movements, suggest that focusing on spiritual or selfless aspects of relationships might be beneficial. It is advisable to seek matches that align with your deeper values rather than superficial attractions. Continue your search, and with a balanced approach, you may find a suitable partner when Jupiter transits into your 1st house around mid-2027, which could bring more clarity and positive developments in your marital life.

4. gemini-2.0-flash-lite
- I understand your concern about finding a suitable match for marriage. Based on your birth chart data, the current Mahadasha is Jupiter, and the Antardasha is Venus. The influence_now shows that Venus, with a natal strength of 20.0, is the AD lord and is transiting in the 12th house, with an influence score of 11.5. This period, from 12-08-2023 to 12-04-2026, is favorable for marriage. The transit events show that the Sun will transit into the 7th house on 16-01-2026, which is a good time for marriage.

The challenges you are facing may be due to the placement of Venus in the 6th house in your Rasi chart, which can create delays in marriage. The transit of Jupiter in the 2nd house is also a factor. To improve your prospects, consider performing remedies for Venus, such as reciting the Shukra mantra or donating white clothes to the needy. Also, be open to the matches that come your way during the favorable Venus period.

5. gemini-2.0-flash
- Namaste. Based on your birth chart and current planetary influences, the period from August 2025 to August 2027, particularly during Jupiter's transit through your 12th and 1st house, shows promise for marriage. Your current Jupiter Mahadasha and Venus Antardasha suggest a focus on relationships and partnerships. However, Saturn's position in the 9th house in transit and natal chart may be causing delays and obstacles in finding a suitable match. The transit of Mars and Venus also plays a role in the timing of events.

To improve your chances of finding a suitable match, consider strengthening Venus in your chart. This can be done by donating to charities on Fridays, wearing white or light-colored clothes, and using perfumes. Additionally, offering prayers to Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati can help remove obstacles in marriage. You should be careful in selecting a life partner. Marriage to a number 8 born on the seventeenth or eighth of any month is better than marriage to other numbers.

6. Claude Haiku 3.5 (claude-3-5-haiku-20241022)
- Based on your chart's current planetary periods and transit configurations, I perceive significant marriage-related challenges during your Venus and Jupiter periods between 2025-2027. Your current Venus antardasha (active now) suggests emotional turbulence in relationships, while Jupiter mahadasha indicates potential transformative personal growth.

The primary astrological factors causing your marriage difficulties are Mercury's strong influence (scoring 58.63 in current transit) and Moon's placement in the 12th house, which suggests internal emotional blockages and potential psychological barriers in forming meaningful connections. Remedially, I recommend performing Vishnu Sahasranamam chanting, wearing a pearl (representing Moon's energy), and focusing on self-improvement between 01-01-2026 and 31-12-2027. These periods show promising alignment for relationship potential, particularly when your emotional intelligence and communication skills are deliberately enhanced.

7. Claude Haiku 3 (claude-3-haiku-20240307)
- Based on the analysis of your astrological chart, there are a few key factors that seem to be contributing to the challenges you are facing in finding a suitable marriage partner:

Your current Mahadasha (major planetary period) is of Jupiter, which will last until 30-09-2031. During this time, your Antardasha (sub-period) of Venus is ongoing until 29-09-2029. The Venus Antardasha can bring attraction and romantic opportunities, but the overall Jupiter Mahadasha may not be the most favorable for marriage. The transit positions of the planets also indicate that the next 1-2 years may not be the ideal time for you to get married. 

The Yoni (sexual compatibility) between you and the prospective brides you have met so far does not seem to be very compatible, as indicated by the Graha-Maitri Koot (mutual love and respect) analysis in your horoscope. This could be a key reason why some proposals have not worked out. However, the good news is that your Dasamsa (D10) chart shows favorable indications for marriage around 2028-2030, when your Jupiter Dasha is in its later stages. With some patience and the right astrological remedies, you should be able to find a suitable life partner during this time period.

8. llama-3.1-8b-instant
- Based on your chart, I have analyzed the current planetary periods and transit events. Your current mahadasha is Jupiter, and the antardasha is Venus, which indicates that you are currently under the influence of Venus, the planet of love and relationships. However, the influence of Venus is not very strong in your chart, with a natal strength of only 20.0. Additionally, the transit chart shows that Venus is currently in the 12th house, which may indicate some delays or obstacles in your marriage prospects.

Considering the transit events, I see that there are some favorable transits coming up, particularly around 23-08-2026, when the Sun will be transiting in the 2nd house, and Venus will be transiting in the 1st house. This could be a good time for you to meet a potential partner. However, it's essential to note that the actual timing of marriage depends on various factors, including your personal efforts and the compatibility with your partner. I would advise you to be patient and focus on self-improvement during this period. It's also recommended to perform some remedies to strengthen Venus in your chart, such as worshiping Goddess Lakshmi or wearing a diamond ring, to enhance your chances of finding a suitable match. With persistence and the right efforts, you can expect a favorable outcome in your marriage prospects around late 2026 or early 2027.

9. llama-3.3-70b-versatile
- Based on your birth chart, I analyzed the current planetary periods, influence, and upcoming transit windows. The current mahadasha is Jupiter (current_md) and the current antardasha is Venus (current_ad), which indicates a focus on relationships and partnerships. However, the influence of Saturn in the 9th house of your rasi chart and the transit of Saturn in the 10th house of your transit chart may be causing delays and obstacles in finding a suitable match. The transit events show that Venus, the planet of relationships, will be transiting in the 12th house of your transit chart from 16-05-2027 to 09-06-2027, which may bring some opportunities, but the aspect of Saturn on Venus may still cause some challenges.

Considering the dasamsa chart (D10) and the navamsa chart (D9), I see some positive indications for marriage between 15-11-2027 and 20-01-2028, when Jupiter will be transiting in the 2nd house of your rasi chart, aspecting the 7th house of partnerships. Additionally, the antardasha of Jupiter under the mahadasha of Jupiter from 23-08-2027 to 26-04-2028 may also bring some favorable opportunities for marriage. It's essential to be patient and not get discouraged by the current rejections. Keep a positive attitude, and with the right mindset, you may find a suitable match during this period. It's also recommended to perform some remedies to strengthen the planets related to marriage, such as worshiping Goddess Lakshmi and performing rituals to appease Venus and Jupiter.

10. meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct
- Based on your birth details and current planetary periods, I have analyzed your chart. You are currently in the Jupiter period, which is a significant time for personal growth, relationships, and marriage. However, your current sub-period is Venus, which is influencing your relationships and marriage prospects. Your natal Venus is strong, but its current transit through the 12th house may be causing delays in your marriage.

Considering your chart factors, I suggest that you focus on self-improvement and spiritual growth during this period. Your marriage is likely to happen around mid-2027, when Jupiter's transit will be favorable, and Venus will be in a more supportive position. Keep in mind that astrology is not an exact science, and individual results may vary. Patience and self-reflection will help you navigate this period and increase the chances of a harmonious marriage.
