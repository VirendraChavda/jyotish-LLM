This science is not experimentally\\ncontrived but perceived through the power of enlightened vision by\\nancient sages and seers, notably among them, Sage Parashara,\\nbelieved to be the original author of the Vedic texts.\\nVedic Astrology is the need of the hour considering the confusing\\nmilieu that boggles the modern world. Despite the apparent\\nachievement of high levels of modern materialistic comfort, we are\\nstill doggedly pursuing sustainable happiness. The primary reason\\nfor this dichotomy is that we don\\'t seem to know or accept that each\\nof us is unique and has different needs and life purposes.\\nVedic Astrology is a tool of wisdom gifted to us by the ancient seers\\nof India to help us understand this uniqueness of our individuality so\\nwe can follow the path of our personal life purpose.\\nThis book is written with the view of teaching the basics of Vedic\\nAstrology to the beginner. And yet, people who already have a\\nreasonably sound knowledge of this fascinating and vast subject will\\nbenefit from it. The book contains numerous aspects of Vedic\\nAstrology within its covers. Knowing you can access a wide variety\\nof topics without having to shift from one book to another is a great\\nadvantage for both new and experienced learners.\\nStarting from the most basic part, namely a simple yet powerful\\nintroduction to this ancient but timeless subject - right up to the\\ncomplex and layered topic of Ashtakavarga tables, this book is great\\nfor all those interested in Vedic Astrology. Furthermore, this book is\\nup-to-date and comprehensive, giving both beginners and experts\\nthe perfect combination to learn and refresh their knowledge on the\\nvarious subtopics of Jyotishya.\\nA beginner can start from Chapter 1 and learn step-by-step as the\\ncomplexity increases. An expert could just flip through the table of\\ncontents and choose a topic he or she needs to access immediately\\nand clear any doubt arising at the moment. Therefore, although it is\\na beginner book, it can be a valuable addition for an expert too.\\n\\nChapter \\n1: \\nIntroduction \\nto \\nAncient \\nVedic\\nAstrological Texts\\nCenturies ago, India\\'s ancient sages and rishis had spoken about\\nthe now-popular concept of self-awareness, which is proven to be\\nhighly beneficial for the growth and development of an individual.\\nThe ancient seers said, \"Self-knowledge is the basis of all\\nknowledge.\" The more you know about yourself, the better your\\nability to assimilate external knowledge learned from books,\\nteachers, guides, and mentors.\\nLearning about yourself includes knowing the effects of the planetary\\nsystem on your life, which is what Vedic Astrology or Jyotishya is\\nabout. Jyotish, in Sanskrit, translates as \"the science of light.\" It is an\\nimportant limb of the Vedas, the ancient sacred texts of India, and\\nthe Sanatana Dharma, which the western world knows as Hinduism.\\nJyotish is referred to with other names and different spellings,\\nincluding:\\n•   Jyotisha\\n•   Jyotishya\\n•   Hindu Astrology\\n•   Vedic Astrology\\n•   Indian Astrology\\nThe term Hindu Astrology has been in use since the beginning of the\\n19th century. Vedic Astrology gained prominence, especially in the\\nwestern world, around the 1970s, thanks to Yoga and Ayurveda\\'s\\nspread. Vedanga Jyotishya is one of the earliest astronomical texts\\nfound within the Vedas, dated many centuries before Christ\\'s birth.\\nVedic Astrology is based on two primary concepts in Hinduism,\\nnamely karma and rebirth. Simplistically put, in Hinduism, the law of\\nKarma states we live and work within certain parameters and\\nlimitations created by actions or karma performed in our previous\\nlifetimes. Therefore, it is possible to predict our future through Vedic\\nAstrology, which has the power to demonstrate which of the previous\\nkarma will come to fruition in the present lifetime.\\n\\nAnd it paves the path to spiritual development by showing how\\nindividuals can improve their quality of life through the practice of\\nhigher thoughts and better living.\\n\\nHistory of Vedic Astrology\\nThere are six Vedangas, the auxiliary disciplines of the Indian Vedic\\nSystem of learning. These six Vedangas or branches of studies are\\nessential for the support of Vedic rituals and education. They are:\\n•   Shiksha (Phonetics)\\n•   Kalpa (Ritual Canon)\\n•   Vyakaran (Grammar)\\n•   Nirukta (Explanation)\\n•   Chhanda (Vedic Meter)\\n•   Jyotishya (Astrology)\\nVedanga Jyotishya is one of the earliest known texts on Vedic\\nAstrology. The extant work is dated to the last few centuries B.C. But\\nit is strongly believed that the Vedanga Jyotishya describes a\\ntradition that goes back at least to 600-700 B.C.\\nThe Vedanga Jyotishya is highly relevant to the dating of the Vedas\\nbecause it depicts the winter solstice for the period around 1400 B.C.\\nThis story of the winter solstice is used to discover the antiquity of\\nthe Vedas. There are two versions of the Vedanga Jyotishya, one for\\nthe Rig Veda and a second one for the Yajur Veda. Both these\\nrecensions have the same verses except for eight extra verses in the\\nYajur Veda recension.\\nExperts believe that the description of the winter solstice around\\n1400 B.C. means the text was written around the same time. Other\\nexperts felt this period\\'s narrative does not mean it was written then\\nbecause it could have been recorded later. Regardless of its\\nantiquity, Vedanga Jyotishya being a significant auxiliary discipline to\\nthe study of the Vedas, reflect the criticality of Vedic Astrology in\\nSanatana Dharma.\\nThe ancient practice of Jyotishya was an important aspect of Vedic\\nrituals, especially to determine the auspicious time and date of yogic\\nevents for optimal benefits for all concerned. In multiple Hindu\\nscriptures like the Chandogya Upanishad and the Atharva Veda,\\nthere are warnings of demonic eclipses we should be cautious of\\nand do the preparation needed for protection against their negative\\ninfluence. Chandogya Upanishad talks of Rahu being a “shadowy”\\n\\nfigure responsible for eclipse occurrences, an accurate analogical\\nexplanation of eclipses, according to modern science.\\nToday, the Sanskrit word, “Graha” means “planet.” But “Graha”\\nactually translates to “demon.” The foundation of Vedic Astrology lies\\nin the core principle of Sanatana Dharma, which believes there is an\\ninfallible connection between the macrocosm and the microcosm.\\nJyotish is like a lens through which we can gain insight about our\\nlives and understand our extended life, which includes the bigger\\npicture, both in the materialistic and the metaphysical world. What\\nhappens to an individual is affected by what happens in the outside\\nworld, including the vast astronomical spaces beyond the realm of\\nhumans.\\n\\nAncient Classical Texts of Vedic Astrology\\nMany classical texts of Vedic Astrology have been in use from\\nancient times to the present day. Important names that come to mind\\nwhen discussing ancient texts are Parashar, Varahamihir, and\\nJaimini. Let us look at the most important works written by these\\nfamous authors and others.\\nBrihat Parashara Hora Shastra\\nBelieved to have been created by Sage Parashara, a highly learned\\nrishi of the ancient Vedic period, the original version of this large,\\nextant text is supposed to have had 100 chapters. However, no one\\nhas the text in its full form. The current form has 13 chapters.\\nNearly all scholars agree that the Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra is\\nthe most comprehensive and exhaustive compendium on Vedic\\nAstrology. Without studying this, no student can hope to become an\\neffective scholar on the subject. Without it, the student\\'s knowledge\\nwill be half-baked, to say the least.\\nThis book contains many important features of Vedic Astrology,\\nincluding but not limited to:\\n•   Description of planets\\n•   Zodiac signs\\n•   Houses\\n•   Divisional charts\\nAll kinds of mathematical calculations needed for Vedic Astrology\\nstudents are described in meticulous detail throughout. Another\\nnoteworthy feature of this work is the availability of remedial\\nmeasures for inauspicious births.\\nBrihat Jatak\\nThis ancient text on Vedic Astrology is believed to have been\\ncomposed and written by Varahamihira, a famous poet and scholar\\nwho was part of the legendary King Vikramaditya, who ruled around\\n57 B.C. Varahamihira was also a great astronomer.\\nHe was the first one to mention ayanamsa or the shifting of the\\nvernal equinox by exactly 50.32 seconds (which is approximated to\\n1-degree) every 72 years. This finds mention in Varahamihira\\'s book\\n\\nPancha Siddhantika based on India\\'s ancient Siddhanta (the\\nMathematical and Astronomical Branch).\\nThe inclusion of the ayanamsa to arrive at the 12 Zodiac signs of\\nVedic Astrology is one of the primary differences between Sidereal\\nAstrology (or Vedic Astrology) and Western (or Tropical Astrology) in\\nwhich this small but impactful shift is not included.\\nOne of the biggest attractions of Brihat Jatak for scholars of Vedic\\nAstrology is the contents of Chapter 10, “Karmajeeva,” which deals\\nwith the livelihoods of individuals. This important chapter deals with\\nthe various earnings that people can have in just four shlokas (or\\nverses). Novices get the feeling that four shlokas are insufficient for\\nan exhaustive repertoire of livelihoods. And yet, the brevity of the\\nchapter speaks volumes on the brilliance of Varahamihira, his\\nimmense control over the language, and the subject of Vedic\\nAstrology.\\nBrihat Samhita\\nConsidered one of the greatest classics of Vedic Astrology, Brihat\\nSamhita was authored by Varahamihira, the same scholar who wrote\\nBrihat Jatak. This text is used to make predictions of nations and\\nkingdoms. It is written in two parts, namely \"Pratham Kanda\"\\ncontaining 57 chapters and \"Dwitiya Kanda,\" containing 50 chapters.\\nVarahamihira believed in the importance of having a genuine\\nastrologer for daily life. He also explains how to identify a genuine\\nastrologer from a fake one.\\nIn the Brihat Samhita, there is an entire chapter titled \"Vastu Vidya\"\\ndedicated to Vastu Shastra (dealing with buildings and architecture),\\nan integral aspect of Vedic Astrology. Many modern astrologers\\nerroneously take Vastu Shastra as being separate from Vedic\\nAstrology. Also, the Brihat Samhita describes in detail how to predict\\nany place\\'s weather and climate.\\nAshtakavarga Nibandh\\nAshta means “eight” in Sanskrit. Therefore, Ashtakavarga Nibandh\\nmeans “Eight Vargas.” In this book, the ancient rishis of India explain\\nand assess the strength of planets in transit. The ancient Indian\\nseers discovered a unique system through the Ashtakavarga\\nNibandh, which helps scholars and practitioners of Astrology\\n\\nunderstand the malignant and beneficial effects of planets on\\nhumankind. Based on pure mathematical formulas, the calculation\\ntechnique used here is unique and not found in any other writing.\\nPrithyusha, the son of Varahamihira, has said of this book, \"The\\ngeneral aspects of planets in transit can be seen or understood\\nelsewhere. However, the finer details can be observed only by using\\nAshtakavarga.\" \\nIn \\nfact, \\nthe \\nAshtakavarga \\nNibandh \\nhas \\na\\nmathematical formula that helps to arrive at the longevity of the\\nnative (or the individual whose horoscope is being analyzed).\\nIt teaches the astrological practitioner to use the Ashtakavarga in\\ndifferent situations and in different charts, including the birth chart,\\nHorary chart, Divisional chart, Varsha Kundali (or the annual life\\npattern), and more. Scholars believe there is no content other than\\nAshtakavarga Nibandh to arrive at an accurate prediction\\nscientifically and mathematically.\\nPhaladeepika\\nPhaladeepika is another important passage written by Mantreswara,\\na prolific author who is believed to have been born in a family of\\nNamboodari Brahmins (a prominent Hindu sect in the southern parts\\nof India) around the 13th century, though some historians believe\\nlived in the 16th century.\\nThe exact dates of his birth and death are not known. At the end of\\nthis work, Mantreswara writes that he resided in Shalivati, the\\npresent-day district of Tirunelveli of Tamil Nadu, a Southern India\\nstate, which is a primary reason for the high popularity of the text in\\nthe southern parts of India.\\nThis book deserves to be treated alongside other great ancient\\nworks like Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra, Jatak Parijata, Brihat\\nJataka, etc. This comprehensive work covers nearly all aspects of\\nhuman life, and its information ranges from the very basic to very\\nadvanced.\\nSaravali\\nWritten by Kalyan Varma, a prolific Sanskrit author of the 10th\\ncentury, Saravali is treated on par with Brihat Parashar Hora\\nShastra, Brihat Jataka, and Sarvarth Chintamani. Kalyan Varma was\\na well-known astrologer and the king of Vyaghrapada believed to be\\n\\nin present-day Madhya Pradesh, a state in Central India. Saravali is\\nan elaborate commentary on all the Vedic Astrology books studied\\nand mastered by Kalyan Varma.\\nSarvartha Chintamani\\nBelieved to have been written in the 13th century by Venkatesha\\nSharma, Sarvartha Chintamani, in Sanskrit, translates to \"Gem of\\nSuperior Desires and Thoughts.\" Containing just 17 chapters, it is\\none of the most popular and most-often cited books on Vedic\\nAstrology. The most important chapters followed closely in this book\\ndeal with the yoga-formation of planets and these yogas\\' outcomes.\\nIt also describes the effects of each house in the natal chart,\\nincluding these elements:\\n•   Description of the planets\\n•   Their effects\\n•   The lifespan of the individual\\n•   Prosperity\\nThis text gives practical and valuable comments relating to placing\\nthe 12 houses on an individual’s birth chart. It then moves on to\\ndescribe the astrological explanations on the position of each house\\nand its impacts on the individual. Sarvartha Chintamani also\\nexpands Varahamihira\\'s thoughts on the profession of Vedic\\nAstrology.\\nJatak Parijaat\\nThis fairly exhaustive work on Vedic Astrology is authored by Sri\\nVaidyanatha Dikshita, the son of another great scholar, Venkatadri.\\nThis work finds a place of honor along with the above three ancient\\ntexts and is also prescribed as a textbook for all examinations\\nconducted on Jyotishya. It contains detailed instructions and\\nsections on various essential aspects, including Yogas, Ayurdaya,\\nAshtakavarga, Vimshottari, Kalachakra Dasha, Stri Jataka, and\\nmore. Translated into multiple Indian languages, this monumental\\nbook is originally in Sanskrit and is held in high esteem by Indian\\nastrologers all over the country.\\nSri Vaidyanatha Dikshita lived in the 15th century and based highly\\nrespected work on various ancient texts, including Brihat Parashara\\nHora Shastra, Brihat Jataka, Saravali, Sarvatha Chintamani, and\\n\\nmore. There are 18 chapters in this book covering the entire range of\\nVedic Astrology, according to the principles of Sage Parashara.\\n\\nBranches of Vedic Astrology\\nThree broad categories include:\\n1. Siddhanta - The Siddhanta branch which deals with\\nastronomy and its astrological applications\\n2.

With a diameter of\\naround 1.4 million kilometers, it is primarily made up of hydrogen and\\nhelium. Over 99% of the total mass of our solar structure is held by\\nthe Sun. The mean distance between the Sun and our planet is\\nabout 140 million kilometers. As it is stationary and at the center of\\nour solar system, it never seems retrograde.\\nThe Sun is the king in Vedic Astrology and is considered a royal\\nplanet. Surya represents many things, including:\\n•   Our soul\\n•   Willpower\\n•   Paternal relations, especially father, called Pitrukaraka (planet\\nconnected with a father)\\n\\n•   The king and other high officials\\nSurya\\'s color is red, which reflects his hot and angry nature. The\\nmetal is gold (like his golden rays), and his gem is ruby. He\\nrepresents the eastern direction. The Sun stays in each Zodiac sign\\nor Rashi for one month and takes 12 months or one year to complete\\nthe full circle of the Zodiac.\\nThe Sun\\'s movement is more or less fixed. Multiple Hindu festivals\\nare celebrated according to the entry of the Sun into the various\\nRashis. For example, it enters Capricorn or Makar Rashi on January\\n14th, and this day is celebrated every year as Makar Sankranti.\\nSimilarly, on April 13th or 14th, the Sun enters Mesha Rashi or the\\nAries, and that day is celebrated as Baishakhi or New Year\\'s Day.\\nSurya in Hindu Mythologyin Hindu Tradition - Surya\\'s story,\\naccording to Hindu mythology, is very interesting. His world is known\\nas Suryaloka and is next to the earth or bhumandala. Surya was\\nmarried to Sanjana, the daughter of the celestial architect,\\nVishvakarma. Surya and Sanjana had three children: Vaivasvata,\\nYama, and Yami. Yama is the god of death. There was marital\\ndiscord between the couple because Sanjana couldn\\'t face her\\nhusband\\'s intense heat.\\nOne day, Sanjana left for her father\\'s abode, leaving behind Chaaya\\n(shadow), her body double. After spending time in her father\\'s place,\\nSanjana left there too. She took on the shape of a mare and went\\ninto the mountains to meditate and pray. Surya was unaware of\\nthese arrangements made by his wife. He continued to live with\\nChaaya, and she gave birth to three more children: Savarni, Shani,\\nand Taapti.\\nOne day, Surya came to know of everything. He went in search of\\nSanjana and found her deep in prayer in the form of a mare. Surya\\ntook on the shape of a horse and wooed his wife, which resulted in\\nthe birth of the horse-headed twin called Ashwini Kumaras, who\\nbecame the celestial physicians.\\nWhen Sanjana told her husband she couldn\\'t handle the intensity of\\nhis heat, he divided his entire power into sixteen parts, which all\\nbecame heavenly bodies, including the earth. The sun was left with\\n\\none-sixteenth part of the intensity he originally had, after which\\nSanjana went back to live with him.\\nSurya\\'s charioteer\\'s name is Arun, and it was pulled by seven horses\\nwhose colors were the same as those in a rainbow. A highly powerful\\nHindu dynasty known as Suryavanshi is believed to be descendants\\nof the Sun God. The first king of the Suryavanshi Dynasty was\\nIkshavku. Lord Rama, believed to be an avatar of Lord Vishnu, was\\nborn in this divine lineage. Surya, the Sun God, is known by multiple\\nother names, including:\\n•   Ravi, which translates to \"praised and worshipped by all\".\\n•   Aditya, son of Aditi\\n•   Surya, the supreme light or guide\\n•   Bhanu, a ray of light or the shining one\\n•   Arka, the radiant one\\n•   Bhaskar, the illuminator\\n•   Mitra, everyone\\'s friend\\n•   Marichi, starlight or rays of light\\n•   Sahasranshu, one with thousand rays\\n•   Savita, the one who purifies\\n•   Pushan, the one who nourishes\\n•   Khag, the one who stimulates the senses\\n•   Prabhakar, the crater of shining light\\n•   Martanda, the one who sprung from a lifeless egg\\n•   Chitrabhanu, the lord of flames\\n•   Divakar, the creator of Day\\n•   Hiranyagarbhaya, the one with the golden womb\\nImportant astrological facts about the sun - The temperament of\\nSurya is steady and fixed. His primary quality is Sattva Guna. He\\nbelongs to the Kshatriya or Warrior Caste. Surya\\'s nature is malefic\\nand cruel. His strength is displayed when he is in the tenth house of\\na native\\'s birth chart, and his weak position is when he is in the\\nfourth house.\\nHis natural astrological house is the fifth house. He rules Leo. His\\nexaltation sign is Aries (or Mesha Rashi), and the sign of debilitation\\nis Libra (or Tula Rashi). Surya\\'s friends are Chandra, Guru, and\\n\\nMangala. His enemies are Shukra and Shani. Sun is neutral with\\nBuddha. The Nakshatras he governs are Krittika, Uttara Phalguni,\\nand Uttarashada.\\nPositive keywords for Surya are vitality, creativity, confidence,\\nleadership, and generosity. Negative keywords for the Sun are\\ncruelty, arrogance, pomposity, conceit, and aggression. Surya is the\\ncontroller of the prana or life force and imparts life-giving properties\\nto all our organs. The planet\\'s position in the birth chart plays an\\nimportant part in the health of the native. Heart problems are\\nprimarily due to the affliction of Surya or Leo, the Zodiac sign he\\nrules.\\nChandra, the Moon\\nThe Moon is the only natural planet of the earth and the only\\nheavenly body visited by humans. With a diameter of 3475\\nkilometers and a mean distance of about 380,000 kilometers from\\nearth, the Moon takes the same time (27.3 days) for one revolution\\naround the earth and one rotation about its axis. This is the reason\\nwe always get to see only one face of the moon.\\nThe Moon is also a royal planet and is considered the Queen in the\\nhierarchy of Vedic Astrology. Chandra represents emotions, mind,\\nmother, sensitivity, house, and household-related elements, including\\nfood and clothing, domestic comforts, sea, and all elements\\nconnected to the sea, milk, and the color associated with the Moon,\\nwhite. She is cool, calm, and represents the north-eastern direction.\\nHer metal is silver, and her gem is pearl.\\nChandra is the fastest moving of the Navagrahas and takes about 2\\n½ days in each Rashi. When Surya and Chandra are in the same\\nRashi or Zodiac Sign, it is Amavasya or the New Moon Day, which is\\nalso the first day of the dark fortnight. When the Sun and Moon are\\nopposite each other, otherwise known as 180-degrees apart, then it\\nis the Full Moon Day or Purnima, the bright fortnight\\'s first day.\\nChandra in Hindu Mythology - Another interesting story is that of the\\nMoon or Chandra. Anasuya was the wife of Sage Atri, a great rishi of\\nancient times. Anusuya was known for her chastity. One day, the\\nthree prominent Hindu Gods, namely Vishnu, Shiva, and Brahma,\\n\\ntested her abstinence. They visited her in disguise and demanded\\nthat she feed them her breast milk.\\nAnusuya saw through the trick and changed the three gods into\\nbabies through her divine powers. It was now not a problem feeding\\nthe three babies the milk of her breast. The gods were pleased with\\nher behavior and attitude and blessed her to have great sons.\\nThrough Vishnu\\'s grace, Anusuya gave birth to Lord Dattatreya.\\nShiva\\'s blessings resulted in the birth of Sage Durvasa. Lord\\nBrahma\\'s blessings resulted in the birth of the Moon God, Chandra.\\nChandra was worshipped by all beings. He married the 27 daughters\\nof Prajapati Daksha, and these 27 daughters became the 27\\nconstellations or Nakshatras in the Zodiac. Interestingly, he preferred\\nto remain with only one of his 27 wives and ignored the other 26\\ndespite them pleading with him to spend time with them all equally.\\nThe 26 daughters complained to their father, Prajapati Daksha, who\\nwarned his son-in-law of dire consequences if he is not fair to all his\\nwives. Chandra did not heed his father-in-law\\'s advice, who cursed\\nhim to fall ill. Every day, his glow faded, and there seemed to be no\\nremedy for his illness. The gods were alarmed at the effects of life on\\nearth if Chandra died.\\nSo, they approached Daksha and requested him to adjust the curse\\nso life on earth remains unaffected. Daksha agreed to change the\\ncurse only after Chandra promised to spend one day each with his\\n27 wives. With the curse modified, Chandra\\'s would wane for 14\\ndays and regain the glow during the next 14 days, which is the story\\nof the moon\\'s waxing and waning cycle.\\nLike the Suryavanshi, Chandravanshi was another powerful dynasty\\nthat ruled over India. The Chandravanshis believed they were direct\\ndescendants of the Moon God. The first king of the Chandravanshi\\nDynasty was Bharat, the legendary ruler, after whom India gets its\\nSanskrit name.\\nImportant astrological facts about the moon - The sign in which the\\nMoon is placed during your birth is called Janma Rashi. And the star\\nconstellation is your Nakshatra. Moon represents mind and emotion\\nand signifies the mother relationship. Chandra\\'s astrological nature\\n\\nis fickleness and changeability. The element governed by the Moon\\nis water. The primary guna of Chandra is Sattva.\\nAstrologically, when the moon is waxing, its nature is beneficial.\\nDuring the waning period, he has a malefic effect. The Moon\\'s\\nstrength is felt when he is in the Fourth House, and his power is\\nweak when in the 10th house. The Moon rules over the Zodiac sign,\\nCancer. Surya and Shukra are his friends, and he has no enemies.\\nPositive elements connected with Chandra are receptivity, sympathy,\\ngood memory, and protectiveness. Negative elements relating to\\nChandra are touchiness, emotional instability, worry, moodiness, and\\nsmothering love.\\nMangala, Guja, or Mars\\nMangala Gruha, Mars is the first planet closest to earth\\'s boundary in\\nspace. With a diameter of about 6700 kilometers, this fourth planet in\\nour Solar System takes 687 days for one revolution around the Sign;\\nthe period of rotation on its axis is just over 24 hours. It has two\\nnatural satellites, namely Phobos and Deimos. The retrograde period\\nof Mangala Gruha ranges between 60-80 days and happens once\\nevery 26 months.\\nMangala or Guja in Hindu mythology – Once, Prajapati Daksha\\norganized a grand yagna. All the gods and goddesses from all the\\nthree worlds were invited for this fabulous yagna. Out of earlier spite,\\nDaksha deliberately left out Lord Shiva, who was also his son-in-law,\\nfrom the invitation list.\\nSati, Lord Shiva\\'s wife, and Daksha\\'s daughter were keen ongoing\\nfor the yagna even without an invitation. Lord Shive did not agree\\nand warned her not to go to her father\\'s house. But Sati ignored her\\nhusband\\'s warnings and went to her father\\'s abode.\\nOn reaching the place where the yagna was being conducted, Sati\\nwas insulted by her insolent, arrogant father, who also made\\nunpleasant remarks about Lord Shiva. Sati was so furious with\\nDaksha she cursed the yagna and all the other invitees who did not\\nfind the courage to protest the powerful Daksha\\'s unjust opinions.\\nEventually, Sati was consumed by the fire of her anger.\\nShiva was livid when he heard of his wife\\'s death. He tore a matt of\\nhair from his head in a rage, and using his divine powers; he molded\\n\\na thousand-limbed, ferocious monster named Virabhadra. Shiva\\nordered his son, Virabhadra, to destroy Daksha along with his\\nsupporter. Virabhadra completed this mission with resounding\\nsuccess, which pleased his lord and father.\\nVirabhadra and Shiva\\'s other son, Lord Karthikeya, became\\nbrothers. This is the reason natives afflicted with the negative effects\\nof Mangala Gruha pray to Lord Karthikeya for release.\\nImportant astrological facts about Mars - Mars stands for strength\\nand power and signifies siblings. His hierarchical position in Vedic\\nAstrology is that of the army commander. Temperamentally, Mangala\\nGruha is rash, angry, and violent.

This planet takes 88 days to complete one\\nrevolution around the Sun and about 59 days for one rotation around\\nits axis. It has no natural satellite of its own. Its retrograde period is\\n\\nabout 20 to 24 days, which takes place once in approximately four\\nmonths.\\nBuddha in Hindu Mythology - According to Hindu mythology,\\nBuddha is Chandra, the Moon God\\'s son. Chandra became a\\npowerful divine being and conquered the three worlds, which led to\\nhim becoming highly arrogant. Chandra was one of the primary\\ndisciples of Guru, or Jupiter, the guru of the Devas. He was also a\\nfavorite of Jupiter\\'s wife, Tara.\\nOne day, when Jupiter was away, Tara and Chandra eloped. On\\nreturning home, when Jupiter found his bride missing, he realized\\nwhat had happened. He sent multiple messages to Chandra to\\nreturn his wife honorably to him. Chandra paid no heed to these\\nrequests, saying that Tara came of her own accord and would leave\\nhim only when she is satiated. Jupiter now turned to another of his\\ndisciples, Indra (the king of gods), for help. Indra sent an ultimatum\\nto Chandra to return their guru\\'s wife.\\nWhen Chandra refused to comply with his ultimatum too, Indra\\nwaged war against the Moon God. Venus (Jupiter\\'s enemy), along\\nwith the Asuras, took Chandra\\'s side while Lord Shiva and many\\ndevas fought alongside Indra in this war. The war went on for so long\\nthe wise sages feared the end of the world was near. Lord Brahma\\nthen ordered Chandra to return Tara to Jupiter. This time Chandra\\nobliged, but not before making her pregnant with his child.\\nJupiter forced Tara to abort Chandra\\'s child. But the baby who was\\nradiant and golden survived. Seeing the beauty of the baby, both the\\nMoon and Jupiter claimed paternity. Both demanded that Tara\\ndeclare the true name of the baby\\'s father. Lord Brahma had to\\ninterfere again and asked Tara for the baby\\'s father\\'s name in\\nprivate. At this point, Tara said that Chandra was the father of the\\nchild who was none other than Mercury or Buddha.\\nImportant astrological facts about Mercury - known as the prince in\\nVedic Astrology, Mercury is a masculine planet.

Its retrograde period\\nis about 40-43 days, which happens once every 19 months.\\nShukra in Hindu Mythology - Shukra was the guru of the Daityas\\nor Asuras. He knew the secret use of Sanjivini Vidya with which it\\nwas possible to revive the dead. He used this powerful knowledge to\\nrevive dead asuras. Also, Shukra was immensely learned and an\\nastute Brahmin. He was handsome, intelligent, and sensuous. His\\nfather was Rishi Bhrigu, and his mother was Puloma.\\nOne day, Venus was enjoying the beauty of nature as his father,\\nRishi Bhrigu, was deep in meditation nearby. Venus fell hopelessly in\\nlove with Apsara Viswachi, who had come to that spot. He followed\\nher to heaven and created a small hut for her, living happily with\\nViswachi for many years until the effects of his good karma ended.\\n\\nWhen his good karmas ended, Shukra\\'s soul fell to the moon and\\nthen to the earth, where he was born as the son of a virtuous\\nBrahmin. He led an austere life on Mount Meru for a long time until\\nhe met Viswachi again, who was cursed to be born as a female deer.\\nShukra fell in love with the deer, and through their union, a human\\nchild was born.\\nThen, the life of the Brahmin who held Shukra\\'s soul ended. After his\\ndeath, Shukra was reborn as the prince of Madra, which he ruled for\\nmany years. Like this, Shukra\\'s soul was reborn multiple times on\\nearth until his final birth was that of a son of a learned seer who lived\\non the banks of a river.\\nMeanwhile, Rishi Bhrigu opened his eyes after thousands of human\\nyears had passed and saw the worn-out body of his dead son,\\nShukra. In anger, he was about to curse Yama, the Lord of Death,\\nwho appeared before him and reminded him that Shukra\\'s karma\\nresulted in his multiple births and deaths. And that, right then, he\\nwas meditating on earth on the banks of a river.\\nThe Lord of Death revived Shukra\\'s body, who realized the truth\\nbehind his numerous births and deaths he had to undertake to\\ncleanse himself of all karmic effects. Venus then meditated on Lord\\nShiva to achieve spiritual salvation. After thousands of years of\\nmeditation, Lord Shiva appeared to Shukra, taught him the Sanjivini\\nVidya, and gave him the boon of being the most auspicious planet\\namong the nine planets.\\nEven today, marriages are performed only when Venus is rising in\\nthe sky. After that, Shukra had many wives and was blessed with\\nseveral children too.\\nImportant astrological facts about Venus - Venus is the guru of the\\ndemons or asuras and is known as Daitya guru.

It retrogrades\\nfor about 110 days every approximately once every year.\\nGuru in Hindu Mythology - Guru or Brihaspati was one of Rishi\\nAngiras\\' eight sons. His mother and Rishi Angiras\\' wife was\\nShraddha. After receiving the basic knowledge from his father, he left\\nhome in search of spiritual intelligence. He meditated for thousands\\nof years to gain insight and wisdom. His relentless penances earned\\nhim a position of guru to the gods. His primary purpose was to\\nprotect and advance the interests of the devas (or gods) and thwart\\nthe designs and intentions of demons (or Asuras).\\nOnce Shukra, the guru of the Asuras, went to the Himalayas to\\nmeditate and seek the power to conquer and destroy the devas from\\nLord Shiva. Indra, the devas’ king, sent his daughter, Jayanthi, to\\ndeceive Shukra with her amorous charms and learn whatever Lord\\nShiva would teach him. She stayed with Shukra for many years until\\n\\nLord Shiva appeared and taught them everything they wanted to\\nlearn.\\nWhen it was time to return to the devas\\' abode, Jayanthi had a\\nchange of heart. She revealed her true identity to Shukra and\\nrequested him to accept her as his wife. He agreed to her request\\nbut said he would be with her only for 10 years, and during this\\nperiod, they would live alone.\\nJupiter used this period of 10 years to disguise himself as Shukra so\\nhe could live with the Asuras and remove hatred and factionalism\\namong them. Guru disguised as Shukra endeared himself to the\\nAsuras. When the real Shukra returned, the Asuras were confused\\nby two identical-looking gurus. They declared Jupiter (disguised as\\nShukra) to be their real guru. The real Shukra got angry and cursed\\nthem they would be destroyed soon.\\nSoon after, Jupiter changed into true form and left the Asuras\\' abode\\nand went to the heavens. The demons now realized their mistake\\nand rushed to their real guru and begged for his forgiveness. He\\nrelented and returned to be their guru. But his curse could not be\\ntaken back, and the Asuras became very weak to threaten the\\ndevas. In this way, Jupiter served his ardent followers, the devas.\\nImportant astrological facts about Jupiter - Brihaspathi or Guru is\\nknown as the Devaguru or the guru to the gods. He represents\\nspirituality, wisdom, temples, priests, research and science,\\nteachers, lawyers and judges, and knowledge of astrology and other\\nShastras in the Sanatana Dharma.

Next, Shani looked at Arun,\\nSurya\\'s charioteer, who fell and broke his thighs. When he next\\ngazed at the seven horses of Surya\\'s chariot, their eyes turned to\\nstone, and they became blind.\\nThe Sun God tried various remedies to cure everyone. Although,\\nnothing worked. Only when Saturn turned his gaze away did Surya\\'s\\nskin cleared, Arun\\'s thighs were healed, and the seven horses got\\nback their eyesight. Shani performed many years of penance at the\\nholy city of Benares, where Lord Shiva appeared before him and\\ngave him the position of a planet in the Zodiac.\\n\\nShani is the god of longevity, justice, death, and time.

He represents sorrow, hard work, old\\nmen, servants, and other lower-level workers such as those in the\\niron and steel industry, drainage work, and municipality.

He rules over Makar and\\nKumbh Rashis. His friends are Shukra and Buddha, his enemies are\\nSurya, Chandra, and Mangala, and he has a neutral relationship with\\nGuru. The three Nakshatras he lords over include Pushya,\\nAnuradha, and Uttara Bhadra.\\nThe positive keywords related to Shani are experience, humility,\\npatience, compassion, and wisdom. The negative emotions\\nconnected with Saturn are sorrow, challenges, delay, limitation, and\\ndisappointment.\\nRahu, or the Dragon\\'s Head, or the Lunar North Node and Ketu, or\\nthe Dragon\\'s Tail, or the Lunar South Node\\nAccording to Vedic Astrology, Rahu and Ketu stand for the two points\\nof intersection between the Sun and Moon’s paths as they move\\naround in the Zodiac. They are called the south and north lunar\\nnodes. Eclipses occur when the Sun and the Moon are at one of\\n\\nthese two places, which gave rise to the myth of the sun being\\nswallowed.\\nRahu and Ketu in Hindu Mythology - Rahu\\'s father was Viprachitti,\\nand his mother was Simhika. Simhika was the sister of Prahlad, the\\nardent Asura devotee of Lord Vishnu. Ketu is the dismembered body\\nwhile Rahu is the head. Their story is part of the story of Amrit\\nManthan or the Churning of the Ocean.\\nThe devas were losing their power, thanks to Sage Durvasa\\'s curse.\\nThe king of devas, Indra, lost his kingdom to the Asuras. They went\\nto Lord Brahma for help, who directed them to go to Lord Vishnu.\\nVishnu told Indra to approach the Asuras and ask for their help in\\nchurning the ocean so they could both get amrita, the nectar of\\nimmortality. Indra suggested to the Asuras that both could share the\\nnectar and become immortal. The Asuras agreed to help in the\\nchurning of the ocean.\\nMount Mandara was used as a rod, and Serpent Vasuki was used as\\na churning rope. Lord Vishnu took the form of a gigantic tortoise to\\nhold up Mount Mandara and prevent it from slipping into the ocean.\\nAs the churning began, the Asuras on one side and the devas on the\\nother, many things emerged from the ocean.\\nThe poison, halahala, was the first thing that came up. It threatened\\nto destroy both the devas and asuras. But Lord Shiva came to their\\nrescue. He swallowed the poison and held it at this throat for eternity.\\nOther important elements that emerged from the churning included\\nthe celestial horse, Ucchaishravas, Kamadhenu, the wish-fulfilling\\ncow, Airavata, the white celestial elephant, Lakshmi, the goddess of\\nwealth and prosperity, Apsaras, the beautiful dancers, the\\nKausthubha gem, and much more. Finally, the god of medicine,\\nDhanvantri, emerged holding a pot filled with amrita. The asuras\\nsnatched it and refused to share it with the devas.\\nAt this time, Lord Vishnu was Mohini, an irresistible enchantress\\nwhom the asuras lusted after. They handed over the pot of nectar to\\nMohini and agreed to allow her to distribute the amrita as per her\\nwishes. She asked the devas and asuras to sit in a line and\\ndistributed the nectar, beginning with the devas.\\n\\nRahu realized something was amiss. He disguised himself as a deva\\nand sat between Surya and Chandra, who recognized him\\nimmediately. Vishnu, in the form of Mohini, threw his discus and\\nsevered Rahu\\'s head. But Rahu managed to drink one tiny drop of\\nthe nectar, making himself immortal just in time.\\nTherefore, although his head and body were separate, both the parts\\nremained immortal. The head was called Rahu, and the headless\\nbody got the name Ketu. These two are continually chasing the Sun\\nand Moon gods because they were the ones who sneaked to Mohini\\nabout his presence. When they catch him, they swallow the sun and\\nmoon, causing solar and lunar eclipses. But, as Rahu and Ketu\\ncannot hold him for long, the sun and moon come out intact because\\nthey have also had their share of the nectar of immortality.\\nImportant astrological facts about Rahu - This shadow planet\\nrepresents foreign countries, foreigners, international travel, smoke,\\nengineering and technical industries and trade, drinking, gambling,\\ngrandparents. He also represents the underworld and the dark,\\nshadow life in a society. Rahu\\'s color is black, he represents a mixed\\nmetal, and his gem is Gomedh or hessonite garnet. Rahu takes\\nabout 1 and ½ years to travel a Zodiac sign, and therefore, takes 18\\nyears to complete one round of the Zodiac.\\nRahu represents maternal grandparents and is known for spiritual\\nknowledge. He represents the air element. Rahu lords over Ardra,\\nSwati, and Shatabhisha Nakshatras. Rahu\\'s positive keywords are\\nindependence, originality, inspiration, insight, and imagination and\\nnegative keywords are deception, confusion, addiction, illusion, and\\nneurosis.\\nImportant Astrological Facts About Ketu - Representing\\ngrandparents, spiritual inclinations, technical and electronics trades,\\nsuperstitions, Ketu, like Rahu, takes about 1 and ½ years to\\ncomplete one Zodiac. Ketu represents paternal grandparents and\\nstands for moksha or ultimate liberation. The temperaments of both\\nRahu and Ketu are unpredictable and erratic. Ketu represents the\\nfire element. The primary quality of Rahu and Ketu is Tamas. Their\\nnatures of both planets are malefic.\\n\\nKetu rules over Ashwini, Magha, and Moola Nakshatra. Rahu and\\nKetu\\'s friends are Shukra, Mangala, and Shani, their enemies are\\nSurya and Chandra, and they have a neutral relationship with Guru\\nand Buddha. Ketu\\'s positive keywords are self-sacrifice, idealism,\\nspirituality, compassion, and intuition, and negative keywords are\\neccentricity, fanaticism, amorality, violence, and impulsiveness.\\nEach of the nine planets has different effects, good and bad, on the\\nnative’s life depending on their placements in the various Rashis.\\nInterestingly, the effects on a person\\'s life could be diagrammatically\\nopposite to that of another individual. Seven out of the nine (Rahu\\nand Ketu are left out) planets also rule the seven days of the week\\nas under:\\n•   Surya rules Sunday.\\n•   Chandra rules Monday.\\n•   Mangala rules Tuesday.\\n•   Buddha rules Wednesday.\\n•   Guru rules Thursday.\\n•   Shukra rules Friday.\\n•   Shani rules Saturday.\\nNow that you have a good idea about the nine planets and their\\nsignificance, it is time to see how they influence our daily lives.\\n\\nChapter 3: Planetary Influences on Daily Life\\nUnderstanding planetary influences on our daily life requires us to\\nknow more about the relationships shared by the nine planets, their\\npositions on the Zodiac, and the direct and special aspects of each\\nplanet. Let us know more about these and other elements in Vedic\\nAstrology.\\n\\nFive-Fold Relationship\\nCalled Panchada Maitri in Sanskrit, planetary relationships are\\ncomplex. It is important to know that the power of a planet depends\\non his own position and the relative position with other planets.\\nPlanets are powerful if they are in any one of these positions:\\n•   In the house of the sign(s) of their exaltation.\\n•   In their own house.\\n•   In the house of their friends.\\nPlanets are weak when, in one of these positions:\\n•   In the house of their enemies.\\n•   In the house of the sign(s) of their debilitation.\\nThe strength of the planets is neutral in the house of neutral signs.\\nWhen two planets have a relationship-based influence over each\\nother, then the effects on the concerned natives depend on the\\nquality of these interplanetary relations. The planets have different\\nrelationships and friends, including a great (or fast) friend (ati mitra),\\na good friend (mitra), neutral (sama), bitter enemies (ati shatru), and\\nenemies or inimical (shatru). This concept is called Panchada Maitri,\\nwhich is of four types of relationships, including:\\nParivartana or Exchange Relationship - This two-way exchange is\\nthe most powerful of all the four types. It is based on mutual sign\\nownership. This happens when two planets are in two houses owned\\nby each other.\\nAspect or Drishti Relationship - This is a one-way exchange\\nwherein one planet is in the house owned by another planet. Also,\\nthe house is aspected significantly. If the aspect is almost total, then\\nthis relationship is also very powerful.\\nPosited in the Same Sign - When two planets are posited together\\nin the same sign, then too, the exchange is powerful.\\nMutual Aspect - This happens when two planets mutually aspect\\neach other. If this happens at near-total levels, then too, the\\nexchange can be powerful.\\nThe interplanetary relationships of each planet are also determined\\nby their Tatkalik (temporal) and Naisargik (natural or permanent)\\nfriendships. Permanent friendships and relationships depend on the\\n\\nplanets\\' natural status, whereas temporal relationships depend on\\nthe position of the planets in individual horoscopes.\\nThe third relationship is the neutral type (or Sama), wherein the\\nplanets are neither friends nor enemies but are neutral towards each\\nother. Both enjoy equal status. The relation is always seen from the\\nperspective of the planet under consideration. For example, suppose\\nyou want to see the link of Surya with other planets. There, its tie is\\njudged from Surya\\'s viewpoint and is independent of the other\\nplanet\\'s attitudes toward Surya.\\nChart analysis is rarely done using Naisargika relationships. It is only\\nused to compute Panchadha Maitree. The temporal links are the\\nones used for chart analysis. So, if Chandra is not hostile towards\\nany planet in its Naisargika relationships, then it only means that in\\nthe Panchada Maitri Scheme, he will never be a sworn enemy of\\nother planets. Although, if there is hostility from Chandra\\'s\\nperspective in the Tatkalika relationships, then it can be hostile to\\nanother planet in the Panchada Maitri Scheme.\\nNaisargika friendship works like this. Satyacharya\\'s rule governs\\nNaisargika relationships. From the Mooltrikona sign of any graha, the\\nlords of the 2nd, 4th, 5th, 8th, 9th, 12th, and the lord of the exaltation\\nsign are his friends. The lords of the other houses, namely the 3rd,\\n6th, 7th, 10th, and 11th, are hostile towards this planet. But the lord\\nof the planet\\'s exaltation sign will also be a friend, even if he is in\\none of the inimical houses. The lords who own both are neutral. If a\\nplanet becomes a friend and enemy because of owning two houses,\\nthen it is considered a neutral planet.\\nNaisargika friendships are permanent and are not influenced by the\\nposition of the planets in the elliptical. The planets are friendly or\\nhostile due to their inherent characteristics. The rays of the planet\\nwill be intensified by the rays of mitra planets and counteracted or\\nweakened by enemy or shatru planets.\\nTatkalik relationships work like this. The planets in the second, third,\\nfourth, eleventh, or twelfth houses from each planet become\\ntemporary mitra or friends, and the planets in the other houses are\\ntemporarily inimical.\\n\\nPanchada Maitri is arrived at by combining Naisargika and Tatkalika\\nfriends:\\n•   If two planets are friendly in both Naisargika and Tatkalika\\nperspectives, then they are extremely friendly in the native\\'s\\nhoroscope; permanent friend + temporary friend = best friend.\\n•   If they are friendly through one view and have a neutral\\nrelationship through the other, then the result is friendly;\\npermanent friend + temporary enemy = neutral.\\n•   If enmity combines with affinity, then the result is equality;\\npermanent enemy + temporary friend = neutral\\n•   Enmity combining with neutral results in enmity.\\n•   If there is enmity from both accounts, then the result is\\nextreme enmity; permanent enemy + temporary enemy = bitter\\nenemy.\\nThe Mooltrikona positions of the seven planets are:\\n•   Surya in Simha Rashi up to 20-degrees.\\n•   Chandra in Vrishabha Rashi up to 27-degrees.\\n•   Mangala in Mesha Rashi up to 12-degrees.\\n•   Buddha in Kanya Rashi up to 20-degrees.\\n•   Guru in Dhanush Rashi up to 10-degrees.\\n•   Shukra in Tula Rashi up to 15-degrees.\\n•   Shani in Kumbha Rashi up to 20-degrees.\\nUsing these rules, the friendship-enmity relationships of Naisargika\\nfriendship for each of the seven planets is:\\nSurya - Surya represents good fortune, soul, career, father-figure,\\nand authority. The aspects of the Sun are not malefic in nature.\\nHowever, he can cause feelings of cruelty, egotistical acts, and\\nselfishness.\\nThe Mooltrikona is Simha Rashi (Leo). The 4th, 2nd, 12th, 5th, 9th,\\nand 8th houses hold Mangala, Buddha, Chandra, Guru, Mangala,\\nand Guru, respectively. Surya\\'s sign of exaltation is Mangala.\\nTherefore, Mangala, Buddha, Chandra, and Guru are his friends.\\nThe lords of the 3rd, 6th, 7th, 10th, and 11th in relation to Surya are\\nShukra, Shani, Shani, Shukra, and Buddha. Shani and Shukra are\\n\\nSurya\\'s enemies. Buddha holds a house of a friend and that of an\\nenemy for Surya. Buddha has a neutral relationship with Surya.\\nChandra - Chandra or the Moon desires family, mind, and the mind\\'s\\nobsessions and home. The Mooltrikona of Chandra in Vrishabha\\nRashi (Taurus). The 4th, 2nd, 12th, 5th, 9th, and 8th houses hold\\nSurya, Buddha, Mangala, Buddha, Shani, Guru, who are Chandra\\'s\\nfriends. Chandra\\'s exaltation sign is Shukra, who is also Chandra\\'s\\nfriend, regardless of the house he occupies.\\nThe lords of the 3rd, 6th, 7th, 10th, and 11th, in relation to Chandra\\'s\\nMooltrikona, are Chandra, Shukra, Mangala, Shani, and Guru,\\nrespectively. Shukra has an inimical position with respect to Chandra\\nand his sign of exaltation. Shukra\\'s relationship with Chandra is\\nneutral. Similarly, Mangala, Shani, and Guru will have a neutral\\nexchange with Chandra because they share a friendly and an\\ninimical relationship.\\nBuddha - Buddha or Mercury represents speech, intellect, learning\\nand understanding, communication, and profession. The Mooltrikona\\nof Buddha is Kanya Rashi (Virgo). The lords of the 4th, 2nd, 12th,\\n5th, 9th, and 8th houses in accord to Buddha\\'s position are Guru,\\nShukra, Surya, Shani, Shukra, and Mangala, resulting in a friendly\\nrelationship with Buddha (Mercury). The sign of exaltation is Mercury\\nhimself.\\nThe lords of the 3rd, 6th, 7th, 10th, and 11th houses are Mangala,\\nShani, Guru, Buddha, and Chandra. Using the Panchada Maitri\\nrules, Mangala and Shani have a neutral relationship with Buddha\\nbecause they are lords of friendly and an inimical house in accord to\\nBuddha\\'s Mooltrikona position.\\nShukra - Shukra or Venus represents love, sensuality, peace, sex,\\nmaterialistic comforts, and love-based relationships. The Mooltrikona\\nof Shukra is Tula Rashi (Libra). The lords of the 4th, 2nd, 12th, 5th,\\n9th, and 8th houses in relationship to Shukra are Shani, Mangala,\\nBuddha, Shani, Buddha, and Shukra, respectively, giving them a\\nfriendly relationship. The sign of exaltation of Shukra is Guru.\\nThe lords of the 3rd, 6th, 7th, 10th, and 11th houses are Guru, Guru,\\nMangala, Chandra, and Surya, subsequently, giving them an inimical\\n\\nrelationship with Shukra. Guru and Mangala will have a neutral link\\nwith Shukra as each occupies a friendly and an inimical house.\\nMangala - Mangala or Mars desires and represents conflicts,\\nambition, power, and property. The Mooltrikona of Mangala (Mars) is\\nMesha Rashi (Aries). The lords of the 4th, 2nd, 12th, 5th, 9th, and\\n8th houses in relationship to Mars are Chandra, Shukra, Guru,\\nSurya, Guru, and Mangala, respectively, giving them a friendly link\\nwith Mars. The sign of exaltation of Mangala is Shani.\\nThe lords of the 3rd, 6th, 7th, 10th, and 11th houses regarding Mars\\'\\nMooltrikona position are Buddha, Buddha, Shukra, Shani, and Shani,\\nthen giving them a relationship of enmity. Shukra and Shani will have\\na neutral relationship with Mangala because they occupy a friendly\\nand an inimical position.\\nGuru - Guru represents knowledge, spirituality, good fortune, values,\\nand religion. The Mooltrikona of Guru (Jupiter) is Dhanush Rashi\\n(Sagittarius). The lords of the 4th, 2nd, 12th, 5th, 9th, and 8th\\nhouses in relationship to Guru\\'s Mooltrikona position are Guru,\\nShani, Mangala, Mangala, Surya, and Chandra, resulting in a\\nfriendly relationship. Guru\\'s sign of exaltation is Chandra.\\nThe lords of the 3rd, 6th, 7th, 10th, and 11th houses regarding Guru\\nare Shani, Shukra, Buddha, Buddha, and Shukra, resulting in an\\ninimical relationship. Shani has a neutral relationship with Guru.\\nShani - Shani represents suffering, hard work, poverty, illness, and\\nfinality. The Mooltrikona of Shani (Saturn) is Kumbh Rashi\\n(Aquarius). he lords of the 4th, 2nd, 12th, 5th, 9th, and 8th houses in\\nrelationship to Shani are Shukra, Guru, Shani, Buddha, and Shukra,\\nrespectively, giving them a friendly relation. The sign of exaltation of\\nShani is Shukra.\\nThe lords of the 3rd, 6th, 7th, 10th, and 11th houses regarding Shani\\nare Mangala, Chandra, Surya, Mangala, and Guru, giving them a\\nrelationship of enmity with Shani. Guru shares a neutral relationship\\nwith Shani because he occupies a friendly and an inimical position.\\n\\nNatural Friends and Enemies of Rahu and Ketu\\nRahu stands for manipulation, enjoyment, and ambition. He can\\ncause cheating, shocks, and losses for natives. Rahu\\'s Mooltrikona\\nis Mithuna Rashi (Gemini). So, his friends should be the lords of\\nCancer, Virgo, Libra, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Taurus. His enemies\\nwould be the lords of Leo, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Pisces, and Aries.\\nRahu\\'s exaltation sign is Taurus, which is the 12th house from his\\nMooltrikona, already a friendly position. According to the Panchada\\nMaitri rules, Chandra, Shukra, and Rahu are natural friends of Rahu,\\nwhereas Surya, Mangala, and Guru are his natural enemies. Buddha\\nis neutral.\\nKetu has no aspects because he represents no desires. Ketu\\'s\\nMooltrikona is Dhanush Rashi (Sagittarius). So, Ketu\\'s friendly signs\\nare Capricorn, Pisces, Aries, Leo, Cancer, and Scorpio. His enemy\\nsigns are Aquarius, Taurus, Gemini, Virgo, and Libra. Ketu\\'s\\nexaltation sign is Scorpio, which is already in a friendly relationship\\noccupying the 12th house.\\nKetu\\'s friends are Surya, Chandra, and Mangala, while his natural\\nenemies are Shukra and Buddha. Shani and Guru have a neutral\\nrelationship with Ketu.\\nThe following list summarizes the friends, enemies, and neutral\\nrelationships of the nine planets:\\nSurya - Surya\\'s (or the Sun) friends are Moon (Chandra), Mars\\n(Mangala), and Jupiter (Guru). His enemies are Shukra (Venus),\\nShani (Saturn), and Rahu. Neutral planets are Buddha and Ketu.\\nChandra - Chandra\\'s (or the Moon) friends are Surya and Shukra.\\nHis enemies are none, and he has a neutral relationship with\\nMangala, Guru, Shukra, Shani, Rahu, and Ketu.\\nBuddha - Buddha\\'s (or Mercury) friends are Surya and Shukra. His\\nenemies are Chandra and Ketu. He has neutral relationships with\\nMangala, Guru, Shani, and Rahu.\\nShukra - Shukra (or Venus) friends are Buddha, Shani, and Rahu.\\nHis enemies are Surya and Chandra. He has a neutral relationship\\nwith Mangala, Guru, and Ketu.\\n\\nMangala - Mangala\\'s (Mars) friends are Surya, Chandra, and Guru.\\nHis enemy is Buddha. And he is neutral with Shukra, Shani, Rahu,\\nand Ketu.\\nGuru - Guru\\'s (or Jupiter) friends are Surya, Chandra, and Mangala.\\nHis enemies are Buddha, Shukra, and Rahu. Guru has a neutral\\nrelationship with Shani and Ketu.\\nShani - Shani\\'s (or Saturn) friends are Buddha, Shukra, and Rahu.\\nHis enemies are Surya, Chandra, Mangala, and Rahu. He has a\\nneutral relationship with Buddha and Guru.\\nRahu - Rahu\\'s friends are Shukra and Shani. His enemies are\\nSurya, Chandra, and Mangala. He has a neutral relationship with\\nBuddha, Guru, and Ketu.\\nKetu - Ketu\\'s friends are Surya and Mangala. His enemies are\\nShukra and Shani. He has a neutral relationship with Buddha, Guru,\\nChandra, and Rahu.\\n\\nReciprocal \\nand \\nNon-Reciprocal \\nFriendships,\\nEnmity, and Relationships\\nSurya is friendly with Mangala, Guru, and Chandra. These three\\nplanets, in turn, reciprocate the friendship towards Surya. Surya\\'s\\nenemies are Shani and Shukra, and they, in turn, are Surya\\'s\\nenemies. These relationships are termed as reciprocal.\\nNow, let us take another example. Surya is tolerant or neutral\\ntowards Buddha. Interestingly, Buddha likes Surya and considers\\nhim to be a friend. This kind of relationship is termed as non-\\nreciprocal. The non-reciprocal types of relationships are interesting\\nones and give us a lot of insight and information into life.\\nNon-reciprocal friendships are ambiguously explained in the various\\ntexts of Vedic Astrology. But the most important component to\\nsupport friendships and enmity of a planet with other planets is the\\nplanet itself, the one posited in the Mooltrikona, which is being\\nconsidered. Parashara\\'s text clearly states that the feelings of that\\nplanet towards other planets should be the determining factor of its\\nrelationships with other planets.\\nLogically too, this interpretation makes a lot of sense. Let us look at\\nan example of the non-reciprocal relationship between Surya and\\nBuddha to understand this interpretation. Now, Surya or the Sun\\nrepresents authority and the soul or the consciousness. Buddha\\nrepresents free speech and intellect. There is a complex but\\ninevitable relationship between authority, consciousness, free\\nspeech, and intellect.\\nMercury, the representative of free speech and intellect, likes Surya\\nbecause both representative elements, namely intellect and free\\nspeech, need the support and help of authority/government and the\\nillumination of the consciousness or the soul. So, Buddha or Mercury\\nlikes Surya.\\nNow, let us look at Surya and Buddha\\'s relationship from Surya\\'s\\n(the representative of authority) perspective. The government or\\npeople in authority are not fond of those using free speech or free\\nthinkers. Freethinkers and supporters of free speech are tolerated\\nbut not hated. So, Surya is neutral towards, in other words, he\\n“tolerates” Buddha. This interpretation works for nearly all non-\\n\\nreciprocal relationships. Here are a few more examples which are\\nuseful tools to remember relationships between planets.\\nMercury\\'s non-reciprocal relationships - Next, let us look at Buddha\\nin a little more detail. Mercury likes Venus (Shukra), who\\nreciprocates this friendship happily, which is a reciprocal relationship.\\nMercury tolerates Mars (Mangala). But Mangala hates Buddha.\\nAgain, it is easy to understand logically. Mars represents the military\\nwho hate free thinkers, represented by Mercury. Freethinkers, on the\\nother hand, put up or tolerate the military and the police because\\nfree thinkers not only understand the perspectives of the police and\\nmilitary, but they also need them for protection and security.\\nAnother non-reciprocal relationship of Mercury is with Saturn.\\nMercury is neutral (or tolerates) Shani, whereas Shani likes Mercury.\\nShani is antagonistic towards authority, which can turn off Mercury.\\nAlthough Mercury is lighthearted, he can tolerate Shani but cannot\\nbe on friendly terms.\\nMercury and Jupiter (Guru) also share a non-reciprocal relationship.\\nWhile Jupiter hates Mercury, Mercury is tolerant towards Jupiter.\\nJupiter stands for religion and dogma. Freethinkers and free speech\\nsupporters are continuously finding ways to embarrass religious\\ndogmas even if they are open to (or neutral towards) religion. At this\\njuncture, it might make sense to recall Shukra\\'s mythology (born of\\nChandra and Tara, wife of Guru), who is the bastard son of Jupiter.\\nSo, while Mercury embarrasses his stepfather, Jupiter hates his\\nbastard son.\\nVenus\\' non-reciprocal relationships - Venus is a friend of Saturn and\\nMercury, and both these planets reciprocate the relationship. In\\nVedic Astrology, the friendship between Venus (Shukra) and Saturn\\n(Shani) is of legendary quality and is believed to be one of the\\nstrongest relationships, comparable to the relationship between Mars\\n(Mangala) and Sun (Surya).\\nVenus\\' arch enemies are the Sun and Moon, and it is easy to\\nunderstand this, considering that Venus represents creativity and the\\narts, both of which are usually anti-authoritarian. The Sun also\\ndislikes Venus. But the Moon tolerates Venus\\' hatred.\\n\\nVenus and Mars are neutral towards each other, representing the\\nnatural male-female dynamics of the universe. After all, men and\\nwomen cannot live without each other, and yet find it difficult to live\\nhappily with each other, and end up tolerating one another.\\nVenus has a neutral relationship with Jupiter, although Jupiter does\\nnot like Venus. Again, this neutrality versus dislike non-reciprocal\\nrelationship is easy to understand. Venus stands for love, peace, and\\nsensuality and can easily see value in religion and philosophy\\nrepresented by Jupiter. While numerous forms of art and artists have\\nbeen supported by religion, a lot more art-related works and people\\nhave been censored by religion.\\nWhile most artists tolerate religion, religion dislikes nearly all artists\\nand artworks not conformed to or aligned with its beliefs and\\ndogmas. Religion uses censorship to demonstrate its dislike for art.\\nMars\\' Non-Reciprocal Relationships - Mars and Jupiter have a\\nreciprocal friendly relationship. Mars representing energy and\\npassion, knows he needs guidance represented by Jupiter. And\\nMars represents the enforcement agencies like the police and\\nmilitary, and Jupiter represents the morality-based order of\\nenforcement, resulting in mutual, reciprocal friendship.\\nMars and Saturn share a non-reciprocal relationship. Shani,\\nrepresenting anti-authority, hates the commanding and enforcement\\ntendency of Mars. But Mars appreciates the practicality and tenacity\\nof Saturn or Shani, and tolerates him.\\nJupiter\\'s Non-Reciprocal Relationship - Jupiter and Saturn\\ntolerate each other because religion and morality (Jupiter) are\\ninextricably intertwined with finality, represented by Saturn.\\nTherefore, both tolerate each other even if they are totally opposite\\nof each other.\\nInterestingly, no one really dislikes Jupiter, including the planets\\nwhom he ill-treats (Venus and Mercury). This likable aspect of\\nJupiter is based on all positive elements, including good deeds. He is\\na very sensitive lord and deals sensitively with others, even when\\ndoing something bad. Hence, no planet really dislikes Jupiter.\\n\\nChapter 4: House Systems and Characteristics of\\nBhava\\nUnderstanding the systems of houses in Vedic Astrology is the start\\nof the basics of this fascinating subject. The Zodiac elliptical is 360-\\ndegrees, which is divided into 12 equal divisions of 30 degrees each.\\nEach division is called a Zodiac sign or house. This 12-house system\\nstarts from Aries and finishes at Pisces.\\nEach of the 12 signs has one ruler (a planet), and planets rule two\\nsigns (dual ownership). An important element about dual ownership\\nis that when a planet rules over two signs, then one of them is more\\nimportant than the other. This concept is relative and is regardless of\\nthe planet and the signs it rules over. The more important sign\\nbecomes the Mooltrikona sign for that planet.\\nIn Vedic Astrology, a planet is a heavenly body being considered in\\nthe Zodiac elliptic. The word “planet” should not be confused with its\\nastronomical meaning. Planets need not be the same as defined by\\nPhysics and Astronomy. For example, Sun and Moon are taken as\\nplanets, even if Physics calls Sun a star and Moon a natural satellite.\\nTo reiterate an earlier lesson, the nine primary planets of Vedic\\nAstrology are Sun (Surya), Moon (Chandra), Mars (Mangala), Jupiter\\n(Guru), Saturn (Shani), Mercury (Buddha), Venus (Shukra), and\\nRahu and Ketu. These last two are called Shadow Planets. Rahu\\nand Ketu are not physical entities. They are imaginary points on the\\nZodiacal elliptic, where the axis of the Sun and Moon overlap,\\nrelative to earth. It is important to know that Rahu and Ketu are\\nmathematical calculations and not physical entities like the other\\nseven heavenly bodies collectively known as planets. The effects of\\nRahu and Ketu are so powerful on horoscopes that the ancient seers\\nthought it important to give them planet status. They are always at\\n180-degrees from each other.\\nRahu and Ketu do not rule over any signs considering they are not\\nphysical entities. But they are co-rulers of certain signs. Also, these\\ntwo astrological elements are called shadow planets because they\\nmirror the effects of the planets they are close to or the signs they\\noccupy temporarily.\\n\\nThe 12 Houses or Bhavas\\nThe 12 houses and their ruling planets are:\\n1. Aries (Mesha Rashi) -ruled by Mars (Mangala); the Mool\\nTrikona (MK) sign for Mars in Aries\\n2. Taurus (Vrishabha Rashi) - ruled by Venus (Shukra)\\n3. Gemini (Mithuna Rashi) - ruled by Mercury (Buddha)\\n4. Cancer (Karkata Rashi) - ruled by Moon (Chandra)\\n5. Leo (Simha Rashi) - ruled by Sun (Surya)\\n6. Virgo (Kanya Rashi) - ruled by Buddha and Rahu - MK sign\\nof Buddha\\n7. Libra (Tula Rashi - ruled by Shukra (MK sign)\\n8. Scorpio (Vrishchika Rashi) - ruled by Mars (Mangala) and\\nKetu\\n9. Sagittarius (Dhanush Rashi) - ruled by Jupiter (Guru) - MK\\nsign\\n10. Capricorn (Makar Rashi) -ruled by Saturn\\n11. Aquarius (Kumbh Rashi) - ruled by Saturn (MK sign) and\\nRahu (co-ruler)\\n12. Pisces (Meena Rashi) - ruled by Jupiter\\nThe term “Bhava” in Sanskrit means state or condition. In Jyotishya,\\nBhava is used to denote a fixed division in the Zodiac. It corresponds\\nto the term \\'house\\' used in Western Astrology. A natal or birth chart\\nin Vedic Astrology is called bhavachakra, where chakra means\\n“wheel” or “circle”.\\nAll charts have the same twelve bhavas or houses measuring 30\\ndegrees each. The difference between individual charts is which\\nhouse is taken as the first house, second house, and so forth until\\nthe 12 house. The Lagna or the Ascendant Sign determines the first\\nhouse. The Lagna is the sign rising in the east at the time of the\\nnative\\'s birth. The Lagna house is the first house for that person, and\\nthe others follow counter-clockwise, in the same sequence as the\\nZodiac elliptic.\\nThe twelve houses rule over numerous aspects of an individual\\'s life.\\nElements that each house rules over are given below. But it is\\nimportant to remember that this list is not exhaustive.\\n\\nThe First House - Or the Lagna bhava, primarily represents the\\nnative\\'s personality.

In the same\\nway, the ninth house represents destiny and good fortune. The 12th\\nfrom the 9th house is the 8th bhava, which is bad fortune and\\ndestruction.\\nGenerally, houses 1, 5, and 9 are considered to give good things,\\nincluding wealth, good health, good fortune, wisdom, education, etc.\\nalthough there are other caveats to be considered for an accurate\\nunderstanding of a person\\'s birth chart. These three bhavas or\\nhouses are collectively called the “trikona” or triangle or the trine.\\nGuru and Chandra are good when they are in the trine.\\nHouses 1, 4, 7, and 10 are called Kendra or the Center because they\\nrule over most of our day-to-day life elements. These four houses\\nare very important, and planets occupying these houses significantly\\ninfluence the life of a native. The tenth house is the strongest and\\ncan overcome even the ascendant.\\nHouses 6, 8, and 12 are called bad houses or “dusthanas” as they\\nstand for elements and things that oppose our happiness and bring\\ngrief, pain, losses, and agony.\\nA fourth category of bhavas is called Upachaya, remedial, or growth\\nhouses. In these houses, including the 3rd, 6th, 10th, and 11th, the\\nmalefic planets have a tendency to improve. This category is called\\n\"increasing houses,\" which means planets tend to give more over\\ntime. Shani and Mangala do well here and empower the natives with\\nenergy and strength to overcome obstacles. Malefic planets do well\\nin the 11th house.\\nApachaya or the houses of decrease include 1st, 2nd, 4th, 7th, and\\n8th bhavas, where the planets lose their strength. Malefics do not do\\nwell in these houses.\\nAnother category called succedent or fixed includes the 2nd, 5th,\\n8th, and 11th bhavas. They reflect the accumulation and\\n\\nmaintenance of our resources.\\nThe cadent category includes the 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th houses.\\nThey give flexibility, intelligence, and adaptability. But they can get\\nunstable and uncertain, leading to mental and nervous issues.\\nFurther, the 12 houses or bhavas are divided into four categories\\nbased on the four important goals of human life as follows:\\n1. Dharma - 1st, 5th, and 9th houses stand for dharma, which\\nreflects our need to find the path and purpose of our lives.\\n2. Artha - the 2nd, 6th, and 10th houses represent the artha or\\nwealth creation. These three bhavas reflect the human need to\\nacquire the necessary materialistic abilities and resources to\\nachieve our purpose.\\n3. Kama - the 3rd, 7th, and 11th houses stand for pleasure and\\nenjoyment, a basic need of human life.\\n4. Moksha - the 4th, 8th, and 12th houses represent our desire\\nfor enlightenment and freedom from the struggle of the limitless\\ncycles of birth and death.\\n\\nUnderstanding Bhavatah Bhava\\nBhavatah bhava means the future bhava from a particular house.\\nBhavat translates to “future.” Bhavatah Bhava applies to the house\\nthat is the same number as the house counted from the Lagna\\nbhava. Bhavatah Bhava is like a house or bhava being born again in\\nthe future. Bhavatah bhava is an important technique used in Vedic\\nAstrology to make accurate predictions. Let us look at examples to\\nbetter understand the concept of Bhavatah Bhava:\\n•   The 3rd bhava or house because it is the 2nd house of the\\n2nd house. Counted in the same way (considering houses are\\ncounted counterclockwise in a circular path), the 3rd house is\\nalso the bhavatah bhava of the 8th house (because it is the 8th\\nfrom the 8th house). In the same way, the following bhavatah\\nbhavas can be arrived at:\\n•   The 11th house is the bhavatah bhava for the 12th (12th from\\n12th) and the 6th (6th from the 6th house).\\n•   The 5th house is the bhavatah bhava for the 3rd house and\\nthe 9th house.\\n•   The 9th house is the bhavatah bhava for the 11th and the 5th\\nhouses.\\n•   The 7th house is the bhavatah bhava for 4th and the 10th\\nhouses.\\n•   The 1st house is the bhavatah bhava for the 7th house.\\nIn this concept, the bhavatah bhava concept reflects sharing similar\\nindications. For example, the 5th house stands for intellect and\\nreflects the wisdom and deep learning. The 9th house, which is the\\nbhavatah bhava for the 5th house, also supports these attributes as\\nit stands for higher education or university education.\\nSimilarly, the 5th bhava supports and aligns with the indicators of the\\n3rd house. To recall, the 3rd house reflects initiation into meditation\\nand spiritual practices. The 5th house supports this by pursuing deep\\nknowledge, wisdom, mantra chanting, etc. The reverse is also true.\\nThe 5th house reflects an appreciation for entertainment, and the 3rd\\nhouse supports this aspect because it reflects music and drama.\\n\\nWith this basic understanding of house systems and bhavas, we can\\nnow move on to Siddhant Shastra in the next chapter.\\n\\nChapter 5: Siddhant Shastra: Mathematical and\\nAstronomical Principles\\nWe will focus on the basic astronomical and mathematical\\nbackground of Vedic Astrology. These aspects of Vedic Astrology are\\ndescribed in Siddhant Shastra, which deals primarily with the\\ncalculations of lunar and solar months, the speed and distance of\\nplanets and constellations, and axes\\' calculations of the various\\nplanets.\\nThe Surya Siddhanta, translated to \"The Treatise of the Sun,\" is a\\nSanskrit text in Indian Astronomy. With 14 chapters, this 8th-century\\ntext describes detailed rules and formulas to calculate the planets\\'\\nmotions relative to the 12 asterisms. It also describes how to\\ncalculate the orbits of heavenly bodies.\\nThe Surya Siddhanta asserts that the earth is spherical and that it\\norbits the sun. It does not mention Uranus and other faraway\\nplanets. It is easy to understand this, considering there were no\\ntelescopes and viewing these far-off planets was impossible through\\nthe naked eye.\\n\\nUnderstanding Ayanamsa\\nAyan means precession or movement or motion, and Amsha means\\na “portion” or “part”. Ayanamsa translates to a part or portion of the\\nmovement (relating to heavenly bodies). Ayanamsa refers to the\\namount of precession. It stands for the angular difference between\\nthe vernal equinox and sidereal Zodiac.\\nAyanamsa is the reason there could be differences in calculating\\nDasas among the various astrologers. Ayanamsa\\'s idea plays an\\nimportant role in determining divisional charts, determining planetary\\npositions, Dasas, transits, and more. Ayanamsa usage can bring\\nabout significant changes in Dasa balances and in high-precision\\nVarga Charts such as Shastiamsa.\\nWe must understand the concept of the preceding equinoxes to\\nimprove our understanding of the meaning and effects of Ayanamsa.\\nWhat are equinoxes? When the celestial equator intersects the\\necliptic (or the path of the planets), two points of intersection are\\ncreated, namely the Spring Equinox and the Fall Equinox.\\nSpring Equinox falls on March 21st, while the Fall Equinox is on\\nSeptember 21st every year. The Rashis or planets passing through\\nthese two equinoxes are continually changing. The Rashis\\ncontinuously precede these equinoxes, taking 25800 years for all the\\nRashis to pass through these two equinoxes once. The Rashis get\\npreceded, which is called the preceding of the equinox.\\nAyanamsa is the difference in the angular distance created each\\ntime there is a precession in the equinox. According to Siddhanta\\nShastra, the precession happens at the rate of one degree every 72\\nyears, which translates to about 50 seconds every year. Ayanamsa\\ncan be defined as the difference between tropical (Western) and\\nsidereal (Vedic Astrology) Zodiac. The seemingly small difference is\\nleft out for calculations in Western Astrology, whereas it is included in\\nSidereal or Vedic Astrology leading to more specific calculations, and\\ntherefore, increasingly accurate predictions in the latter.\\nIn 285 A.D., the positions of the planets in both the Sidereal and\\nTropical systems were in sync, which means in that year, there was\\nno Ayanamsa, and there was no precession in that year. In 285 A.D.,\\n\\nthe planetary positions were the same in both the western and Vedic\\nastrological systems.\\nBut, as precessions started, the differences between the two\\nsystems started, and continues to do so, and will continue at the rate\\nof approximately one degree every 72 years. So, in 285 A.D., the\\nayanamsa was 0, and in 2010, the value was approximately 24\\ndegrees, which means to say, one must subtract the planet position\\nin the tropical version by 24 degrees to arrive at the sidereal length.\\nThe vernal equinox is the position used to measure planetary\\nlongitudes and is known as the planet\\'s sayana position. Sayana\\nmeans “along with the component of differences in degrees”. The\\nNirayana longitude position is obtained after applying the ayanamsa\\ncorrection to the value of the sayana position. Nirayana means\\n\"without the difference in degrees.\" Western Astrology uses sayana\\nlongitudes, whereas followers of Vedic Astrology use the Nirayana\\nsystem.\\nAn interesting calculation is here to help you understand the impact\\nof Ayanamsa. Approximately 11200 years; hence, the ayanamsa will\\nbe exactly the opposite, which means to say, there will be a 180-\\ndegree difference between Sidereal and Tropical Astrological\\nSystem calculations! About 11200 years; if the Sun is positioned in\\nAries according to the tropical system, the sun will be in Libra,\\naccording to Vedic Astrology! Now, that is a big difference, right?\\nThe tropical system superimposes the Zodiac every year on March\\n21. For western astrology, on March 21st every year, the Sun is\\nalways in Aries. The Sidereal system calculates the positions after\\nconsidering the planets\\' position behind the Rashi system. These\\ntwo points differ, resulting in the differences between the predictions\\nmade according to your Sun Sign in tropical and Sidereal systems.\\nThe most accepted form of Ayanamsa is the Chitra Paksha\\nayanamsa proposed by N. C. Lahiri and approved in 1954 by the\\nAstrological Research Institute, Kolkata, India. Most astrologers use\\nthis ayanamsa for their calculations. While scholars continue to\\ndebate on which is the best and most efficient ayanamsa to follow,\\nas a beginner, you can easily learn about this important element\\nusing the Chitra Paksha method.\\n\\nHere are important terms used in Ayanamsa:\\nCelestial Latitude - Also called Shar or Vikshep, the celestial\\nlatitude is the angular distance of an imaginary arc drawn from the\\nplanet to the ecliptic.\\nUttarayana - This term refers to the period when Surya enters\\nMakar Rashi and begins his journey towards the north. Uttarayana\\nstarts from Makar Sankranti and ends at Mithuna Sankranti. During\\nthis period, the duration of daylight time increases with each passing\\nday.\\nDakshinayana - This term refers to the period when Surya moves\\nfrom Karka Sankranti up to Dhanush Sankranti. During the\\nDakshinayana, the duration of night increases with each passing\\nday.\\nEquinox - There are two spheres, namely celestial spheres and\\nequators, that intersect each other at 23-degrees, 28-minutes. These\\ntwo points of intersection are called equinoxes or equinoctial points.\\nOne is called the Vernal Equinox (Spring Equinox), and the second\\npoint of intersection is called Autumnal of Fall Equinox.\\nThe Sun revolving in the ecliptic crosses the two celestial spheres\\ntwice a year on the equinoxes. On this day, the duration of day and\\nnight are equal. The ecliptic changes result in the Sun rising in the\\nnorthern direction for 6 months (Uttarayana) and in the southern\\ndirection for the remaining 6 months (Dakshinayana). As the Sun\\nmoves away from the Ayana or from the point of precession, the\\nday\\'s duration increases.\\n\\nUnderstanding Dasas\\nOnce you know each of the planets\\' conditions and strengths, you\\nwill know what results you will get from them. But, to know and\\nunderstand when these results will fructify, you must learn and know\\nabout dasas and the transits of the planets through the various\\nRashis.\\nSo, what are dasas? They are the ruling periods of planets. There\\nare many types of Dasa systems used by astrologers all over. But\\nthe most popular, and the most accurate Dasa system is the\\nVimshottari Dasha System. Let us go into this system in a bit of\\ndetail.\\nYou already know that the star constellation in which the moon was\\npassing through becomes your birth Nakshatra. Now, the position\\nand degrees in which this star constellation was placed will\\ndetermine the dasas that will be in operation right through your\\nlifetime. Here is a chart that details the start of a Dasa, depending on\\nthe Nakshatra of your birth. In this chart, we are not considering the\\nmovement of the Nakshatra within its 13-degrees, 20-seconds\\nrange. The start of the Vimshottari Dasa would have to be adjusted\\naccordingly by reducing the time already passed under the effect of\\nthe planet and its lord.\\n1.

The Vimshottari Dasa\\nfollows a period of 120 years of an individual\\'s life. You likely will not\\nexperience all the nine mahadashas in your lifetime. Depending on\\nhow many degrees the moon has traveled at your birth time, your\\nfirst mahadasha is reduced proportionately.\\nNow, every mahadasha is subdivided into dasas of other planets,\\nand these subdivisions are called antardashas. The first antardasha\\nin every mahadasha is that of the mahadasha planet itself, followed\\nby the other planets in their existing sequence. Each antardashas is\\nfurther subdivided into Pratyantar Dashas, and this process is\\nrepeated until we can arrive at the dasas on a daily and even hourly\\nbasis. This book does not cover that detail. This is only to indicate to\\nyou the deep detailing found in Vedic Astrology.\\nWhile the Vimshottari Dasha System is the most prevalent one, you\\ncannot ignore the other dasa systems. Interestingly, although\\nscientifically, there is an agreement in the way stars and planets are\\nplaced in our astral system, there are many differences in terms of\\nAyanamsas and Dasha Systems. A good and well-trained astrologer\\ncan synthesize the interpretations of dasas and by including the\\nayanamsa aspect of Vedic Astrology.\\n\\nChapter 6: The First Four: Aries, Taurus, Gemini,\\nand Cancer\\nFrom this chapter onwards until Chapter 8, we will be looking at the\\nZodiac signs in detail. But before that, let us learn about the\\ncategories into which the 12 Zodiac signs fall. The 12 Rashis, along\\nwith planets and bhavas or houses, form the fundamental elements\\nof Vedic Astrology.\\nThe literal translation of the word “Rashi” is “piling up”. Rashis are\\nnot divine, and they are not worshipped like the planets are. They\\nare mystical and yet have a deep connection to earthly elements. If\\nyou look at the Rashis or Zodiac Signs symbols, they are fish, the\\nbalance, scorpion, and other elements that are part of our earthly\\nlife. Nakshatras and planets are divine. They are deities, and they\\nare worshipped.\\nEven if they are not worshipped and are not divine, the Rashis or\\nZodiac signs hold deep significance in Vedic Astrology. Rashis are\\ncompartments in the sky. They are like an environment. As planets\\nmove on their ecliptic, they come into these compartments or\\nRashis, and depending on the Rashi they enter, the planets behave\\nin a certain way.\\nOne of the basic beliefs of Vedic Astrology is called essential dignity,\\nthe idea that the nine planets are more effective and powerful in\\nsome signs than in others. This is because of the nature of the\\nplanet and the Rashi through which it is transiting through are in\\nharmony. But some planets are weak and have difficult effects while\\npassing through some signs because their natures conflict with each\\nother.\\nSummarily, the effects of planets in each of these Rashis could be\\nfavorable or unfavorable to their natural signification. Here is an\\nanalogy to help you understand this concept. Suppose you are a\\nspiritual seeker and suddenly find yourself in a pub playing loud,\\nraucous music; you wouldn\\'t like it, right?\\nSimilarly, if a particular planet finds itself in a Rashi that does not\\nconform to its core principle, then unfavorable effects arise. But if a\\nplanet finds itself in Rashi or home aligned with its basic nature, then\\n\\nfavorable effects arise. The terms used in Vedic Astrology to explain\\nthis concept are exaltation (supportive environment and conforming\\nto the planet\\'s objectives and goals resulting in favorable conditions)\\nand debilitation (non-supportive environment for the planet resulting\\nin unfavorable conditions and effects).\\nAnother important aspect of the 12 Zodiac signs is that each has the\\nopposite, resulting in six opposing couples. Fire and Air are\\nopposites just as Earth and Water are opposites. Here are the six\\nopposing couples:\\n•   Aries (Mesha Rashi) is opposite to Libra (Tula Rashi)\\n•   Cancer (Karkata Rashi) is opposite to Capricorn (Makar\\nRashi)\\n•   Gemini (Mithuna Rashi) is opposite to Sagittarius (Dhanush\\nRashi)\\n•   Pisces (Meena Rashi) is opposite to Virgo (Kanya Rashi)\\n•   Taurus (Vrishabha Rashi) is opposite to Scorpio (Vrishchika\\nRashi)\\n•   Leo (Simha Rashi) is opposite to Aquarius (Kumbha Rashi)\\n\\nCategories by Flexibility\\nFirst, the signs are categorized into three types based on their\\nflexibility. The three types include Movable, Fixed, and Dual.\\nThe first type or movable signs (also called Cardinal signs) are Aries,\\nCancer, Libra, and Capricorn, which represent adaptability,\\nmovement, activity, quickness, change, reformation, flexibility, letting\\ngo and moving on, and dissatisfaction and restlessness.\\nThe second type of fixed signs is Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, and\\nAquarius. These four signs represent rigidity, gradual but steady,\\nfixed, headstrong nature, resoluteness, determination, dislike\\ntowards movement, and rigid opinions.\\nThe third type of the dual signs (also called mutable signs) are\\nGemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, and Pisces. They are of a dual nature and\\nrepresent a mix of the first and second types. They are oriented\\ntowards learning, philosophical, reading,  communication, speech,\\nand preaching. They are open to new ideas and are always\\nexploring different opinions. They are good at multitasking.\\n\\nCategories by Elements\\nAccording to the elements, the 12 Zodiac signs are categorized into\\nfour types: earth, fire, wind, and water.\\nThe Fire Signs include Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius. They represent\\nenergy, assertion, aggression, passion, willpower, leadership,\\ndecisiveness, outspokenness, extroversion, hot temperament,\\nactive, drive, pioneering, spontaneous, enthusiastic, and impulsive.\\nThe Earth Signs include Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn. The earth\\nsigns represent practicality, caution, methodical and analytical-based\\napproaches, slow and steady, realistic, down-to-earth, accumulating\\nattitude, love reality more than fiction, understand and appreciate the\\nimportance and value of materialistic things.

They represent\\nintellect, \\nquick-wittedness, \\nabstract \\nthinking, \\neager \\nlearners,\\ncommunicative, physically active and agile, love to travel and\\nexplore, great social skills, philosophical attitude, and a flexible\\nattitude.\\nThe Water Signs are Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces.

The credit of the success to\\nmake accurate predictions is largely contributed by these Divisional\\nCharts, which are also known as Varga Charts.\\nVarga is a Sanskrit term meaning “division” called a Zodiac sign or\\nRashi division. Each division or fractional part is called an “amsa”.\\nHere is a simple explanation for you. You already know that each\\nZodiac sign has 30-degrees in its space. In these charts, this sign of\\n30-degrees is further subdivided into different numbers of equal\\ndivisions or amsas.\\nEach planet is again mapped in each of these amsas resulting in\\nDivisional Charts of a native. Each amsa has an influence on the\\nnative\\'s life. Vedic Astrology uses 16 Vargas or divisional charts\\nresulting in a unique system to find the auspicious and inauspicious\\neffects of planets.\\nThe Parashara System of Astrology uses these 16 divisional charts\\nfor predictive astrology. In the Rashi chart, the 12 regions\\ncorrespond to the 12 Zodiac signs. If there are two divisions, then it\\nmeans each house or regions is divided into two amsas or parts,\\nresulting in 24 regions. And this goes on.\\n•   The Rashi Chart (only one division) called D1 is used to\\npredict details about the native\\'s physical matters, including his\\nbody, status of health, and other general matters. The Rashi\\nChart is the basic one where the study of a native\\'s horoscope\\nbegins.\\n•   The Hora Chart (with 2 divisions) called D2 deals with wealth\\nand family. The D2 helps to understand the financial position\\nand matters of the native. A strong position of the Sun in this\\nchart means the quantity of wealth owned by the native will be\\nvery good. If the Moon has a strong position, earning money\\nwill be easy for the native.\\n•   The Drekkana Chart (with three divisions) dealing with\\nsiblings and the nature of the native is called D3. Planets in\\n\\ncertain divisions of this chart can bode badly. For example, if\\nplanets are in the Sarpa Drekkana, then it is not considered\\ngood for the native\\'s health condition.\\n•   The Chaturthamsa Chart (with four divisions) called D4\\ndeals with matters relating to fortune and property.\\n•   The Saptamsa Chart (with seven divisions) called D7 deals\\nwith the aspects of children and progeny.\\n•   The Navamsa Chart (with nine divisions) called D9 is used to\\npredict the spouse (or wife), dharma, and the relationships of\\nthe concerned native. After the Rashi Chart, the Navamsa\\nChart is the most important one used in predictive Vedic\\nAstrology. If a planet is exalted in the Rashi Chart but\\ndebilitated in D9, then the planet may not be beneficial.\\nInterestingly, the lord of the 64th division in D9 is an indicator of\\nlongevity and Marala Dasa (connected to death) of the native.\\n•   The Dasamsa Chart (with ten divisions) called D10 deals\\nwith the native\\'s profession and his or her interactions in\\nsociety.\\n•   Dvadamsa Chart (with 12 divisions) or D12 deals with\\nparents\\n•   Shodasamsa Chart (with 16 divisions) or D16 is for traveling,\\nvehicles, and comforts.\\n•   Vimsamsa Chart (with 20 divisions) or D20 is for spiritual\\npursuits.\\n•   Chatur Vimsamsa Chart (with 24 divisions) or D24 is for\\neducation, knowledge, and learning.\\n•   Sapta Vimsamsa Chart (with 27 divisions) or D27 is for the\\nstrengths and weaknesses of the native.\\n•   Trimsamsa Chart (with 30 divisions) or D30 is for evils, bad\\nluck, and failures.\\n•   Khavedamsha Chart (with 40 divisions) or D40 0s for\\nmaternal legacy.\\n•   Akshavedamsa Chart (with 45 divisions) or D45 is for\\npaternal legacy.\\n\\n•   Shastiamsa Chart (with 60 divisions) or D60 is for part births\\nand karma\\nBesides the above 16 Vargas attributed to Parashara, there are four\\nmore attributed to Jaimini. These four Vargas or divisional charts\\ninclude:\\n1. Panchamsa (with five divisions) is called D5 and represents\\nfame and power.\\n2. Shasthamsa (with six divisions) is called D6, which\\nrepresents health.\\n3. Ashtamsa (with eight divisions), or D8 representing\\nunexpected troubles.\\n4. Ekadasamsa or Rudramsa (with 11 divisions) representing\\ndeath and destruction.\\nThe biggest challenge in drawing up such detailed divisional charts\\nis that the exact time of a person\\'s birth is rarely obtained. Even a\\nminute difference in noting the time of birth could affect the accuracy.\\nThe accurate time of birth is essential because otherwise, the Lagna\\nand other planetary positions can change significantly, resulting in\\nwrong the charts being used to make predictions. But there are\\ncases, especially when the father is a doctor and attended the birth,\\nwhen correct times of birth have been recorded. Then it is possible\\nto create precise charts for the native.\\nOf all the above charts, the Rashi Chart is the primary, and all the\\nother divisional charts and information received from them relate to\\nthis. For example, if Jupiter is in the Mool Trikona in the Rashi chart\\nand it is in a sign of debilitation in D10 or the Dasamsa chart, which\\ndeals with the native\\'s profession and career. The debilitated Jupiter\\nshould give you an indication that the native could be a bad boss\\nwhom people fear and hate at his or her workplace. The 10th house\\nand the lord of the 10th house in the D10 chart is important for\\ncareer-related predictions.\\nIn all the divisional charts, the Kendra houses are the most important\\nones. If the Kendra houses have good planets in them, then the\\nnative\\'s career is likely to do well. So, analyzing the Rashi chart will\\ngive you inputs about the native\\'s profession or career, while the\\n\\nanalysis of the D10 will give you insights into the progress and\\nquality.\\nContinuing further, the benefic planets are depending on the Lagna.\\nSo, for a correct and full analysis of a native\\'s career, you would\\nneed to check the Lagna, the Sun and Moon positions, and the 10th\\nhouse from the Lagna. The same procedure should be used for\\naccurate predictions of other aspects of a native\\'s life using the other\\ndivisional charts.\\nPlanets become increasingly benefic and auspicious if they occupy\\nthe same Zodiac house in the 16 divisional charts. The planets get\\ngraded based on this element. If a planet is stationed in its own sign\\nor the Mooltrikona sign or in any other good sign in two of the 16\\nVargas, it is said to have achieved Parijat Amsa.\\nIf the planet acquires this condition in any three divisional charts, it is\\nsaid to have achieved Uttam Amsa. This gradation of a planet\\nincreases with the number of Vargas with this condition, and the\\nstatus names for each planet are:\\n•   In four Vargas - Gopuramsa\\n•   In five Vargas - Simhasana amsa\\n•   In six Vargas - Paravatmasa\\n•   In seven Vargas - Devlok amsa\\n•   In eight Vargas - Kumkumamsa\\n•   In nine Vargas - Iravatamsa\\n•   In ten Vargas - Vaishnavamsa\\n•   In 11 Vargas - Saivamsa\\n•   In 12 Vargas - Bhaswadansa\\n•   In 13 Vargas - Vaisheshikamsa\\n•   In 14 Vargas - Indrasanamsa\\n•   In 15 Vargas - Golokamsa\\n•   In 16 Vargas - Shrivallabhamsa\\n\\nImplication and Importance of Divisional Charts\\nDivisional charts are essential for a detailed analysis of any\\nhoroscope. One of the primary purposes is to note the placement of\\na planet in different charts. If a particular planet is in a strong position\\nin many divisions, then it is strong. If it is in weak places, then the\\nplanet is rendered weak.\\nA planet located in one Zodiac sign or Rashi by itself is called a\\n“yoga” or an “avayoga” because of the relationship the planet\\nestablishes with the lord of that Rashi as well as the lords of the\\nother related Rashis, especially in connection with Lagna. It is\\nimportant to note that the mere occupation of a planet in a Rashi will\\nnot produce the results or effects in accordance with that occupation.\\nThis is because no planet can act alone. Every planet establishes\\nactive relationships with one or more other planets and the Rashi it\\noccupies, and Varga-wise status gained by the planet and multiple\\nother factors. If a yoga fails to give the expected result, then the\\nreason could be anything. For example, it could be the Varga-wise\\nweakness of the planet rather than the planet itself.\\nLet us take an example to understand this concept. The Sun in the\\n9th house not in any hostile sign gives wealth, friends, piety, and\\nchildren to the native, although this position can drive antagonism\\ntowards the father and wife, having reduced happiness. If the Sun is\\nthe Lagna lord and is in the exalted 9th house, then the native and\\nhis father could have a great relationship, and there need not be any\\nreduction in happy times. So, the expected negative results are\\ncounted by other factors as defined from the divisional charts.\\nFollowing are more examples of using Divisional Charts for\\npredictions.\\nPlanets in Navamsa Affecting Future Life - The Navamsa chart or\\nD9 represents spouse and marriage and the dignity of planets. This\\nchart must be consulted for matters related to marriage, besides its\\nbeing one of the most important divisional charts used for other\\npredictions. D9 is important because it is seen as the fruit if D1 or the\\nRashi chart is the tree. The Navamsa signifies the authentic dignity\\nof a planet because it stands for the planets giving their effects or\\nfruits through its Dasas.\\n\\nFrom a philosophical context, D9 represents the thought process the\\nnative would develop after he or she experiences life and learns from\\nthese events. There arises the concept of D9 triggering future life, or\\nat least later in the current dasa. And the same logic supports the\\nidea that a planet in a strong position in D9 is bound to give better\\nresults later in time or later during its dasa. The Navamsa will depict\\nyour learning from the life lessons the planet offered you.\\nAnother key element to remember is that the idea of exaltation and\\ndebilitation signs are more significant in D1 than in any other\\ndivisional chart. According to Sage Parashara, the exaltation or\\ndebilitation signs and specific degrees are clearly defined. For\\nexample, Chandra is exalted in the 2nd pada of Krittika, which is the\\nfirst Navamsa of Taurus. In the 2nd Navamsa of Taurus becomes the\\nMooltrikona of Chandra.\\nIn Navamsa or any other divisional chart, the second pada of Krittika\\ndoes not fall after the first pada of Krittika. So, with exaltation and\\ndebilitation, the lengths or degrees become immaterial. Only the D1\\nshould be considered for this aspect. Therefore, in this particular\\ncase, Chandra in the second pada of Krittika will not result in\\nanything bad in later life or in the later part of Chandra Dasa.\\nAnother point of interest is that if a planet is weak in the Rashi Chart,\\nits position is not improved significantly, even if it is in a solid position\\nin any of the divisional charts. The reverse is, but different. If a planet\\nis in a strong position, its strength is reduced if it is placed in a\\nposition of debilitation in the Divisional Chart under consideration.\\nHere is an example to illustrate this. Suppose your Rashi Chart has\\nthe lord of the 10th house in an exalted position. If the concerned\\nastrologer has predicted good fortune in your career based on this\\nwithout checking the relevant divisional chart, then this prediction\\nmay not come true. Maybe the same planet is in a debilitation sign in\\nthe D10 (divisional career chart). So, correct predictions, in this case,\\ncan be obtained only by checking and verifying both the D1 and D10\\ncharts.\\nIn summary, we can say this about Divisional Charts. The Rashi\\nCharts are like the human body, which gives you a general\\nunderstanding of a person\\'s life. If you want detailed ways of how the\\n\\ninternal systems are working, you would have to do ECG or biopsy\\nor other tests concerned with that particular part, right? The\\nDivisional Charts are like these detailed studies that give you\\ninformation about specific areas of your life.\\n\\nChapter 10: Planetary Strengths and Avasthas\\nAfter Divisional Charts, we will focus on another powerful predictive\\ntechnique used in Vedic Astrology, namely Planetary Strengths. The\\nvarious longitudinal-based positioning of the planets combined with a\\nconcept called \"six-fold strength\" is a powerful tool used for higher\\nprediction levels.\\nLet us start by understanding what avastha is. It is an important\\nconcept in the world of Vedic Astrology. Avastha in Sanskrit\\ntranslates to “stage,” “state,” or “level.” It refers to the state or stage\\nof planets. There are many types of avasthas, the most basic one\\nhighly useful for beginners being the “Baladi Avastha”.\\nIn the odd Zodiac signs, namely Aries, Gemini, Leo, Libra,\\nSagittarius, and Aquarius, any planet is in the following avasthas\\naccording to the degrees:\\n•   0-6 degrees - The planet is said to be in its infancy avastha,\\nduring which time it will have minimal effects on the native.\\n•   6-12 degrees - The planet is said to be in adolescence\\navastha, and during this period, its entire potential effects can\\nbe experienced.\\n•   12-18 degrees - In this mature state, the planet will render its\\nfull potential.\\n•   18-24 degrees - In this old stage, the planet will have limited\\neffects.\\n•   24-30 degrees - During the last 6-degrees of a Zodiac (near-\\ndeath state), the planet will have very minimal effects, if any.\\nIn the even Zodiac signs, namely Taurus, Cancer, Virgo, Scorpio,\\nCapricorn, and Pisces, the planets are in the following avasthas as\\nper the longitudinal degrees:\\n•   0-6 degrees - Near-death avastha\\n•   6-12 degrees - Old avastha\\n•   12-18 degrees - mature avastha\\n•   18-24 degrees - adolescent avastha\\n•   24-30 degrees - near-death avastha\\n\\nThese degree measurements mustn\\'t be taken literally but\\nconsidered liberally. According to degrees, this differentiation implies\\nthat planets somewhat in the center of a Zodiac sign (between 12 -\\n18 degrees) render their maximum effects. A planet towards the\\nends of the signs tend to blend into the next or previous sign and is\\nnot very deeply colored by the current Rashi. From a mathematical\\nperspective, the 15-degrees point is at the dead center of a sign, and\\nis most affected by the characteristics of that sign.\\n\\nSignificance of Residential Strength of a Planet\\nEvery horoscope has a rising sign called the Lagna or the\\nascendant. It is one of the 12 Zodiac signs, of course. But, according\\nto the precise time of birth, the Lagna will have an exact degree\\nwithin that sign between 0 and 30. This degree becomes an\\nimportant point of every sign for that native\\'s horoscope.\\nLet us take an example. Suppose the ascendant sign is Capricorn at\\n20-degrees for a person. This 2nd house for this person would be\\nAquarius. The 20th degree of the second house will be the exact\\ncenter of the 2nd bhaav, which represents speech, family, wealth,\\nmoney, etc.\\nA planet in any sign at exactly 20-degrees of a house will have 100%\\nof residential strength and give its full potential of effects. The\\nstrength of the bhaav will be good between 15 and 25 degrees (plus\\nor minus 5 degrees). Beyond this limit, the bhaav of that sign will\\ndecrease with every degree away from 20-degrees.\\nIn the same example, if a planet is at 4-degrees of a particular sign,\\naccording to the Baladi Avastha, it belongs to the previous sign. For\\nexample, if a planet is at 2 degrees in Aquarius (the 2nd sign), then\\nalthough it is in the 2nd house, the bhaav of the previous sign will be\\nin effect.\\n\\nSignificance of Nakshatra Placement\\nTo reiterate, there are 12 Zodiac signs of 30-degrees each and 27\\nNakshatras or asterisms of 13-degrees, 20-minutes each. These 27\\nNakshatras are ruled by the nine planets, namely Ketu, Shukra,\\nSurya, Chandra, Mangala, Rasu, Guru, Shani, and Buddha (the first\\nnine asterisms respectively). The same sequence of planet lords is\\nthen maintained for the next 9 Nakshatras, and again for the third set\\nof nine Nakshatras.\\nThe above situation means every one of the nine planets rules over\\nthree Nakshatras equidistant from each other. You already know that\\nthe Nakshatra in which the Moon is housed at the time of a person\\'s\\nbirth becomes the birth Nakshatra of the native. Planets in the 3rd,\\n5th, and 7th Nakshatras from the birth Nakshatra of a person will be\\nweak and give malefic effects to him or her. Planets in the 2nd, 6th,\\nand 9th asterisms will give beneficial effects, and the planets in the\\n1st, 4th, and 8th asterisms will be neutral, although slightly skewed\\ntowards giving positive effects for the native in question.\\n\\nSignificance of Planetary Strengths in Varga\\nCharts\\nSage Parashara, in addition to defining the 16 Varga Charts, also\\ngave a weighted scheme to attribute the importance of these charts\\nto analyze horoscopes and make predictions. This weighted scheme\\nis useful to obtain a quantitative analysis of the effects of the planets\\nusing scores for each planet obtained through this scheme. Higher\\nthe score of a planet, the better the results of that particular in its\\nVimshottari Dasa. High scores reflect the fructification powers of the\\nplanet under consideration.\\nThe weighted scheme given by Sage Parashara uses only six of the\\n16 divisional charts and is:\\n1. Rashi Chart (D1) - 6 points\\n2. Hora Chart (D2) - 2 points\\n3. Drekkana Chart (D3) - 4 points\\n4. Navamsa Chart (D9) - 5 points\\n5. Dwadasamsa Chart (D12) - 2 points\\n6. Trimsamsa Chart (D30) - 1 point\\nEvery planet has a total potential score of 20 points. To reiterate, the\\nexaltation and debilitation effects of planets in divisional charts do\\nnot hold value. The following sequence of houses denotes the\\ndecreasing value of beneficial effects offered by any planet:\\n1. Mooltrikona house\\n2. Own house\\n3. Best friend house\\n4. Friend house\\n5. Neutral house\\n6. Enemy house\\n7. Great enemy house\\nSage Parashara also defined the weightage for each of the above\\nplacements of planets. Let us use an example to illustrate this\\nweightage scheme used in Vedic Astrology. Suppose Mooltrikona is\\n100%, 90% to own house, and so forth. Next, suppose a planet is\\nhoused in the Mooltrikona in D1 and its own house in D9, in the\\n\\nhouse of a best friend in another divisional chart, and so forth. Then,\\nthe weightage scheme looks like this: 100% of 6 + 90% of 5 +...........\\n(similar contributions from the other six divisional charts to be filled\\nhere) to take the total score out of 20.\\nThis total from the weightage scheme will give you a numeric value,\\nwhich is a good indicator of how the planet will behave in its\\nVimshottari Dasa. The reason for Sage Parashara to use this\\nweightage scheme is quite evident. As you already know, the Varga\\ncharts represent the different aspects of our life. For example, D1\\ngives a general outlook on a native\\'s life, D9 is for marriage and\\nspouse, D3 is for siblings, D10 is for career, etc. all of which are the\\nsupport systems of our life. So, the planet\\'s position reflects the\\ndepth and level of these support systems. The better the numerical\\nscore, the better the beneficial effects of that planet.\\n\\nShadbala - The Six-Fold Strength in Vedic\\nAstrology\\nAny planet or Graha gets strength from various sources, including\\nthe Rashi, Varga, Bhava, Day or nighttime, Krishna/Shukla Paksha,\\nand more. Krishna Paksha is the fortnight that starts from the full\\nmoon day (Poornima) to the new moon day (Amavasya). Shukla\\nPaksha is the other fortnight that starts from the new moon day until\\nthe full moon day.\\nShadbala is a mathematical system used to quantify the strength of\\na planet attained through six sources. This number representing the\\nstrength of a planet is an important tool to understand the real impact\\nof the concerned planet on the different aspects of a native\\'s life.\\nDetailed and extensive explanations of assessing a planet\\'s strength\\nare given in the Brihat Parashara Hora Shastras. The unit of strength\\nis measured in Virupas.\\nThe mathematical computation given by Sage Parashara is quite\\ncomplex and layered. But most experienced astrologers can quickly\\nassess the strength of a planet by making a mental model. Let us\\nlook at the six sources of strength used in Shadbala.\\n•   Sthana Bala - The strength of a planet drawn from the\\nvarious positions and stations it takes in the Rashi Chart and\\nother Varga charts are called Sthana Bala or strength from the\\noccupied place.\\n•   Dik Bala - This source of strength of a planet is drawn from\\nits placements in specific Kendras.\\n•   Kala Bala - The strength of a planet that depends on the time\\nof an event or the birth of a person is called Kalabala.\\n•   Chesta Bala - The strength drawn from the movement of the\\nplanet is called Chestbala. The movement of a planet means\\nwhether it is moving fast, slow, forward, or reverse.\\n•   Naisargika Bala - This source of strength is depending on\\nthe natural power (or strengths) and weakness of a planet.\\n•   Drgbala - The strength drawn from the malefic and benefic\\nplanet is called drgbala. The benefic planets (or shubh grahas)\\n\\nare sources of strength, whereas a malefic planet (or papa\\nGraha) is a source of weakness.\\nLet us look at each strength in detail.\\nSthana Bala or the Positional Strength of a Planet\\nThe Sthana Bala of a planet is based on its “placement” or “position”\\nas explained above and represents the “place” factor. “Sthana” in\\nSanskrit translates to “place”. The maximum Sthana Bala strength a\\nplanet can achieve is 390 Virupas comprising of the strengths\\nderived from the six components discussed below:\\n1. Uccha Bala - This position indicates the distance of the\\nplanet from its deepest exaltation point. The closer is this\\ndistance, the stronger the effects of the planet. Maximum\\nstrength - 30 virupas\\n2. Saptavargaja Bala - This indicates the power of a planet in\\nseven divisional charts, including the Rashi Hora Drekkana\\nSaptamsa, Navamsa, Dwadasamsa, and Trimvimsa. Maximum\\nstrength - 225 Virupas\\n3. Ojayuggama Bala - Oja translates to male or odd, and\\nyumna means female or even. This type of Sthana bala is\\nsourced from male and female planets placed in male and\\nfemale Zodiac Signs. Female planets in female signs and male\\nplanets in male signs get this source of strength. A male planet\\nin a female sign or a female planet in a male sign do not derive\\nthis strength. Maximum strength - 30 virupas\\n4. Kendradi Bala - The 1, 4, 7, and 10 bhaavs or houses are\\ncollectively known as Kendra. The 2nd, 5th, 8th, and 11th are\\nknown as Succedent or panapara. The 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th\\nare known as precedent houses or apoklima. Planets in the\\nKendra are the strongest, and those in the apoklima are the\\nweakest. The planets placed in the panapara houses are of\\nmiddling strength. Maximum strength - 60 virupas\\n5. Drekkana Bala - The male planets, namely Sun, Mars, and\\nJupiter, get their full strength in the 1st drekkana (the house of\\nthe sign itself). The female planets, namely Moon and Venus,\\nget their full strength in the 2nd Drekkana (5th house from the\\nRashi). The eunuch planets, namely Mercury and Mars, get\\n\\ntheir full strength in the 3rd drekkana (the 9th house) of a Rashi\\nor house. Maximum strength - 15 virupas.\\nFrom the above discussion, it is clear that if a planet achieves the\\nmaximum Saptavargaja bala, then the quantum of other Sthana bala\\nbecomes insignificant.\\n\\nDik Bala - the Directional Strength\\nThis type of planetary strength is derived from the four Kendras,\\nwhich represent the four directions or Dik. Lagna represents the\\nEast. Jupiter and Mercury get their Dik bala here. The 7th house\\nfrom Lagna represents the West. Shani gets dik bala in this house.\\nThe 10th house represents the South. Mars and Sun get their dik\\nbala in the 10th house. The 4th house represents the North where\\nthe Moon and Venus get their dik bala.\\nAnd the elements or tattva ruling the Lagna are the Akasha (ether)\\nand Prithvi (earth). The element ruling the 4th house is Jala (water),\\nthat ruling the 7th house is Vayu (wind), and that ruling the 10th\\nhouse is Agni (fire). When planets are in their dik balas, then the\\ntattva lording over these houses also gets great prominence and\\nstrength, resulting in the native being blessed by the tattva devata.\\n\\nKala Bala - the Time Strength\\nThis type of planetary strength depends on the time, such as hours,\\nday, night, fortnight, month, year, etc. Each planet is strong at points\\nin time and weak at other times. The maximum strength that can be\\nachieved through Kala bala is 390 virupas. There are five\\ncomponents to Kala bala, including:\\n1. Natonnata Bala - This type of strength is based on day or\\nnight. Some planets are strong at night, and some are strong\\nduring the day. Sun, Jupiter, and Venus are strongest at noon.\\nMoon, Mars, and Shani are strongest at midnight. Mercury is\\nstrong right through the day. Maximum strength - 60 virupas\\n2. Tribhaga Bala - In this type, day and night are each divided\\ninto 3 parts. Then, six planets (excluding Jupiter) get their\\nmaximum strength at different portions of day and night.\\nMercury, Sun, and Saturn are strong in the first, second, and\\nthird positions of the day, respectively. Moon, Venus, and Mars\\nare strong in the first, second, and third portions of the night,\\nrespectively. Jupiter is strong through all the six portions.\\nMaximum strength - 60 virupas\\n3. Paksha Bala - Some planets are strong during Krishna\\nPaksha, while others are strong during Shukla Paksha. The\\nbenefic planets or shubh Grahas Chandra, Mercury, Jupiter,\\nand Venus are strongest during Poornima. The malefic planets\\nare strongest during Amavasya. Maximum strength - 60\\nvirupas.\\n4. Varsha-Maas-Dina-Hora Bala - Different planets rule\\nvarious time segments. It starts with the ruler of the year (Abda\\n- solar year), which is subdivided into four components, namely\\nmonth (Maas - solar month), week (Vara or Dina - Vedic\\nweekday), and hour (hora - graha hour). Each of these four\\ncomponents is stronger than the previous one by 25%, making\\nthe Hora lord the strongest of the four. Vara Lord, which is the\\nsecond strongest, is the Hora Lord at sunrise. Masa Lord, the\\nthird strongest, is the Hora Lord during the transit of the Sun\\nfrom one Zodiac sign to the next. Abda Lord, the weakest of the\\n\\nfour components, is the Hora Lord now when the Sun enters\\nAries. - Maximum strength - 150 virupas.\\n5. Ayana Bala - This source of Kala Bala depends on the\\nmovements of the planets in the Uttarayana or Dakshinayana\\ndirections. Maximum strength - 60 virupas.\\n\\nChesta Bala - Strength from the Motion of Planets\\nChesta in Sanskrit translates to “effort”, and the source of Chesta\\nbala is determined by the efforts or movements made by planets. A\\nplanet that moves steadily is considered making fewer efforts, and\\nwhen moving in retrograde, it is considered making a maximum\\neffort. A retrograde movement can be compared to the movement\\nagainst a flowing current, which requires a lot of effort.\\nThe Sun and Moon always move steadily with no acceleration or\\nretrogression. For planets Mercury to Saturn, Chesta Bala is\\ncalculated on the direction and speed of their movements.\\nCalculating the Chest Bala of a planet uses a complex mathematical\\ncomputation. There are eight different movements and their\\nstrengths defined in Vedic Astrology.\\n1. Vakra - Moving in reverse or retrogression - 100% strength,\\na planet\\'s full brilliance is demonstrated at this strength.\\n2. Anuvakra - Moving to the previous Rashi when in\\nretrogression - 60% strength\\n3. Vikala - No movement; the planet is standing still - 15%\\nstrength\\n4. Manda - Slow-moving, decelerating planet - 30% strength\\n5. Mandatara - Moving very slowly and appearing as if not\\nmoving at all - 15% strength\\n6. Sama - Slow acceleration - 7.5% strength\\n7. Chara - Moving in the forward direction at average speed -\\n45% strength\\n8. Atichara - Moving in the forward direction with above-\\naverage speed - 30% strength\\n\\nNaisargika Bala - the Natural Strength\\nThe natural strength of planets is called Naisargika Bala. Planets get\\nprogressively stronger in the following list:\\n•   Saturn\\n•   Mars\\n•   Mercury\\n•   Jupiter\\n•   Venus\\n•   Moon\\n•   Sun\\nWhen two planets are positioned to mutually influence each other,\\nthen the stronger planet influences the weaker ones and\\npredominantly produces its effects. From the above list, the Sun is\\nthe strongest planet. When any planet is in conjunction with the Sun,\\nthen it becomes combust. The Naisargika Bala of the Sun, while in\\nconjunction with other planets, will never reduce.\\n\\nDrgbala - the Aspect Strength\\nDrgbala is derived from being the natural aspect of the planet,\\nwhether naturally malefic or benefic. The aspect of natural malefic\\nreduces the strength of the planet, while the aspect of natural\\nbenefic enhances its strength. The aspect\\'s strength depends on the\\nlongitudinal difference between the aspected planet and the\\naspecting planet.\\nA naturally benefic planet (Venus, Jupiter, benefic Buddha, and the\\nwaxing Moon) aspects another planet, then it enhances the strength\\nof the aspected planet. Contrarily, when naturally malefic planets\\n(Mars, Saturn, Surya, Malefic Mercury, and the waning Moon) aspect\\na planet, then the aspected planet\\'s strength is reduced.\\nAgain, computing the Drgbala of a planet is complex and time-\\nconsuming. \\nMost \\nastrologers \\nuse \\na \\ncommonly \\naccepted\\napproximation method, which does cause a small error that can be\\nignored.\\nWhile it might be impractical to arrive at the strength of a planet\\nmathematically (considering the complex computation usually\\ninvolved), it is possible to arrive at accurate predictions based on\\nunderstanding the conditions that render planets power. It is not\\nnecessary to know the complete, complex computation processes to\\nknow the strength and the corresponding effects of a planet. A\\nproper understanding of the six-fold strength concept is sufficient. At\\nthis juncture, it makes sense to speak about Chandra\\'s special\\npower or strength, the Moon, considering this planet is seen as the\\nnatural sustainer and nurturer of a horoscope. The waxing and\\nwaning period of the Moon also affects its strength.\\nFor Chandra, Paksha Bala is more important than Sthana Bala.\\nTherefore, even if Chandra occupies a place that weakens its\\nstrength, but is strong because of Paksha Bala, then Chandra is\\nconsidered strong. And if Chandra is placed in a strong position in a\\nhoroscope, the other planets\\' strength gets positively affected, as the\\nMoon lends its power to the others. All the benefic planets acquire\\ntheir strength during Chandra\\'s Shukla Paksha. So, the more\\nstrength Chandra has in its Paksha Bala, the more power the benefic\\nplanets get.\\n\\nChapter 11: Timing of Events: Dashas and\\nTransits\\nAstrology is all about timing future events and making accurate\\npredictions. The Rashi Chart or birth chart of a native gives you an\\ninsight into the inherent promise held in his or her life based on the\\npositions of the planets and other considerations connected to the\\nplanets, Rashis, etc. It only shows you the inherent promise that the\\nlife of the concerned native holds. But, when this promise can turn to\\nfruition \\ndepends \\non \\nelements \\ncalled \\nDashas \\nand \\nthe\\nmovement/transits of planets.\\nYou have read and learned about the Dasa period of each planet.\\nThe total Dasa period of a planet or Graha is divided into multiple\\nparts, which are, in turn, ruled by different planets and their lords.\\nThe Dasa that is operative, and the corresponding results involve\\nvarious factors, including the natural signification of the planet, its\\nruler, its position and placement, aspects, and the strength.\\nThe Dasa\\'s major period is called the mahadasha, subdivided into\\nsmaller periods in which all the nine planets are operative within the\\nmahadasha of a planet. The transit of planets, especially Shani and\\nGuru, plays a crucial role in any important event happening in the\\nlifetime of a native.\\nFor example, Shani Mahadasha will have antardashas (sub-periods)\\nwithin its 19-year duration. For instance, Shukra will be an\\nantardasha within the Shani Mahadasha for 2 years and 9 months.\\nSo, during this period, the effects of Shani Mahadasha, along with\\nVenus antardasha, should be analyzed for accurate predictions.\\nDuring the 2years 9 months period of Venus antardasha, you must\\nknow what both Shani and Venus are doing in the Zodiac sky.\\nThe promise when the effects of good karma fructify will depend on\\nthe Dasa and the planets\\' transit through the Dasa. Let us discuss\\nimportant events that can be accurately predicted based on the birth\\nchart, Dasas, and planets\\' transit. We will use examples to learn\\nabout the topics of this chapter.\\n\\nCase Study I\\nDate of Birth - 13th December 1956; Time of Birth - 11:10 pm;\\nPlace of Birth - Delhi\\nWhen this person was born, the balance of Ketu Dasa happening at\\nthe time (calculated from the time of the native\\'s birth) was 3 years,\\n11 months, and 1 day. Using this information, the Vimshottari Dasa\\nof a person born on the above date, time, and place will be:\\n•   Ketu Dasa (Balance remaining) - up to four years of age\\n•   Shukra Dasa (20 years) - From 4 years up to 24 years of age\\n•   Surya Dasa (six years) - from 24 years to 30 years of age\\n•   Chandra Dasa (ten years) - from 30 years to 40 years of age\\n•   Mangala Dasa (seven years) - from 40 years to 47 years of\\nage\\n•   Rahu Dasa (18 years) - from 47 to 65 years of age\\n•   Guru Dasa (16 years) - from 65 to 81 years of age\\n•   Shani Dasa (19 years) - from 81 to 100 years of age\\nVimshottari Dasa affects the lifetime of a native as follows:\\n•   During childhood - parents and the health of natives\\n•   During adolescence or teenage - education\\n•   During youth - mind, job, and family\\n•   During old age - health, children, and caretaker of the native\\nFor the above example, Ketu Dasa happened until he or she was 4\\nyears old. Ketu was in the house of Shukra in Kendra, which\\nrepresents father. Hence, this child\\'s birth was good in terms of his\\nor her health and the progress of the native\\'s father.\\nFrom 4 years of age onwards, the native was influenced by Shukra\\nDasa. This period affects education. Shukra is in its own house,\\nwhich is also the house of writing and artistic nature. The house of\\neducation is the fourth house occupied by Surya, Shani, and Rahu\\nfor this native. Rahu and Shani result in the child being thoughtful\\nand introverted while Shani also renders interest in science. Buddha\\nin the 5th house results in building the native\\'s interesting in\\ncalculations. Therefore, the native would have likely been educated\\nwith a deep interest in science and mathematics.\\n\\nFrom 24 to 30 years of age, Surya Dasa influenced this native.\\nSurya, in this native\\'s birth chart, is in the 4th house giving the\\nindividual the push needed to start his or her own business and\\nearning a lot of fame at a young age. Chandra, the lord of the 12th\\nhouse, brought luck and good fortune, resulting in good success in\\nbusiness for the native.\\nFrom 40 to 47 years, this native was influenced by Mangala Dasa.\\nEven though Mars is a benefic planet, for this native, it is positioned\\nin the 8th house, which results in a big setback to his profession and\\nbusiness.\\nRahu Dasa for this person is the next. This planet is in debilitation\\nbut is in Kendra, and likely to have had good fortune. However,\\nhealth problems could have come up during the Rahu Dasa for the\\nnative.\\nGuru Dasa sets in only at 62 years for this native, and it might be the\\nbest years of his or her life. The native is likely to lead a restful,\\nserene life during Guru Dasa.\\n\\nTransit of Planets\\nUsually, to study the transit of planets, only Shani, Guru, and Rahu\\nare considered. This is because other planets move fast. Surya,\\nBuddha, and Shukra rotate once a year, Mangala takes two years,\\nChandra takes just a month, and Ketu is always opposite to Rahu.\\nSo, it is enough to see only Shani (Saturn, which takes 30 years to\\ncomplete one cycle), Rahu (which takes 18 years to complete one\\ncycle), and Guru (which takes 12 years to complete one cycle) to\\nstudy the transit of planets.\\nWhen a planet transits through the debilitation signs or the signs\\nowned by its enemies, it will not give good, auspicious results. For\\nexample, when Saturn transits through Leo, Cancer, Scorpio, and\\nAries (also the sign of debilitation), which are owned by its enemies,\\nit will combust and cannot reflect its full potential for about 25 days\\nevery year during the 19-year Mahadasha.\\nFor Shukra, this inauspicious transits will happen when it passes\\nthrough Cancer and Leo, both ruled by Venus\\' enemies. During its\\nown mahadasha, it will combust once in a year for about 20 days.\\nAlso, these transits become very important during the Saturn-Venus\\nsub-period of 2 years and 9 months.\\nWhen the owner of a Dasa or time period is in its sign of exaltation,\\nits own sign, or in the signs of friendly planets, then the concerned\\nGraha will give auspicious effects. In such circumstances, even\\nduring retrogressions, these planets do not give bad effects, and\\nthey could give auspicious effects.\\nFor example, in Shani mahadasha, when Saturn transits through\\nCapricorn, Aquarius, Virgo, Gemini, Libra, and Taurus, which are all\\nexalted signs for the planet, then it will retrograde annually for about\\nthree to four months.\\nFor Shukra mahadasha, this will happen when the planet transits\\nthrough Gemini. Libra, Virgo, Aquarius, Pisces, and Capricorn. The\\nduration of retrograde will be for about three to four months once a\\nyear.\\nTransits of planets are especially significant when they are in\\nconjunction with the Moon. When Saturn crosses over the Moon, it is\\ncalled Sade Sati. The native is likely to face big losses or\\n\\nprogresses, depending on which sign the Moon is in. In the same\\nway, Saturn passing through the 8th house from the Moon also\\nresults in tensions and losses.\\nIn the above example, Guru crossed over Rahu/Shani when the\\nnative was 2, 14, 26, 28, 50, and 62 years of age. Saturn and Jupiter\\nwere in conjunction when the native was 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60\\nyears of age. At the time of these transits, Jupiter was over the 4th\\nhouse over Shani and Rahu, resulting in a change of residence or\\npurchase of a new property. When Jupiter transited over the 7th\\nhouse lorded by Saturn, then the native got married. Saturn over\\nSaturn or Rahu resulted in losing business.\\nAlso, the native experienced Sade Sati in 1968 and again in 1996. In\\n1968, the native lost academic interest, and in 1996, the native\\'s\\nmother fell ill, and there was a death in the family. Short transits\\nshow their results more prominently and effectively than mahadasha\\nand antardashas. Yet, major transits affect the native in a big way.\\nShani transit over Chandra is very important. Guru and Rahu\\ntransiting through the Lagna and the Moon give equal results.\\nTypically, superimposing Dasas over the transit of planets gives\\nmore accurate predictions than otherwise.\\nBesides the Vimshottari Dasha System, the Yogini Dasha System is\\nalso used to calculate Dasas and transits of planets. It is important to\\nrealize the extreme difficulty of making accurate predictions in Vedic\\nAstrology. There are multiple factors to be considered, each of which\\nhas its own rules and regulations for computations and mathematical\\nanalysis.\\nDasas, transits of planets, divisional charts, planetary strengths,\\navasthas, and many more determinants are to be considered before\\naccurate \\npredictions \\ncan \\nbe \\narrived \\nat. Even \\nhelped \\nby\\ncomputational software, the process of predictions for just one native\\ncan take a few hours, or perhaps, more.\\n\\nChapter 12: Ashtakavarga: Destiny Dots at a\\nGlance\\nThis final chapter in this of Vedic Astrology deals with Ashtakavarga\\nor the eight-fold point system used to make predictions by just\\nglancing at a horoscope. Although this tool is an independent\\nsubject, using it with the other tools mentioned in the previous\\nchapters of this book can be a powerful predictive approach. Let us\\nlook at how this technique helps.\\nSage Parashara also mentions the significance of this technique,\\nused not only to determine the beneficial effects of planets through\\nthe Chandra and the ascendant but also to discover the\\nauspiciousness of the houses by studying the transits of planets. The\\nAshtakavarga technique employs Bindu (dots) and Rekha (lines) to\\ndetermine planets\\' position. This powerful tool is considered while\\nanalyzing mahadashas and antardashas of planets.\\nThe Ashtakavarga table has multiple rows and columns. The top row\\nis for the 12 Zodiac signs from Aries up to Pisces. The first right\\ncolumn is the ascendant\\'s degree, and the first left column has the\\nseven planets. Rahu and Ketu do not feature in the Ashtakavarga\\ntable. Instead, the Lagna itself is treated as a complete planet. The\\nrow against each planet represents the planet\\'s score in the Zodiac\\nsign of the respective column head. The last row is the combined\\nscore of each sign regarding the eight planets (including the Lagna).\\nThe last column is the combined score of each planet regarding the\\n12 signs.\\nIn the Ashtakavarga table, the score of each planet-Zodiac sign\\ncombination varies from 0 to 8. Each planet\\'s total score regarding\\nthe 12 Zodiac signs can range from 0 to 56. Only rules must interpret\\nany Ashtakavarga table. Here are the two rules:\\nRule #1 - Look at the row of each planet. You will notice that for\\nevery one of the 12 signs, the planet under consideration gets a\\nscore running from 0 to 8. Each point is an indicator of the planet\\'s\\npower to influence the sign related to the score. Here are the sub-\\nrules related to Rule #1:\\n\\n•   If the planet is in a sign where its score is between five and\\neight, then the planet will give auspicious results.\\n•   If the planet-sign combination score is four, then the results\\nwill be average.\\n•   If the planet-sign score is between zero and three, then it will\\ngive inauspicious results.\\nRule #2 - Next, look at the individual sign totals, which is the last row\\nof the table. The values in this row will range from 0 to 56. This row\\nrepresents the power of each Zodiac sign to give related to its\\nrelationship with the planet position. Follow these guidelines to\\ninterpret the numerical values of this last row:\\n•   A Zodiac sign with a score of over 30 typically gives good\\nresults.\\n•   A sign with a total score of less than 25 means it is\\ninauspicious.\\n•   Signs with scores between 25 and 80 give average results.\\nThe following information can be obtained from an Ashtakavarga\\ntable:\\n•   Weakest house - that house that has the lowest score\\n•   Weak houses - those that have less than 25 points\\n•   Average houses - those with a score between 25 and 30\\n•   Strong houses - those with the highest scores or above 30\\nIt is also important to know what the total score of all the 12 signs put\\ntogether should be 337. If this number is different, then something\\nhas gone wrong in the table. Recheck it before moving on and trying\\nto interpret it.\\n\\nHow to Use the Ashtakavarga Table for Rashi\\nChart Interpretation\\nFirst, mark the Lagna. Then mark the lowest and highest numerical\\nvalue in the chart. Note down the house and Rashis these two\\nnumbers correspond to. Suppose the lowest number is in the 5th\\nhouse, then start your analysis by investigating the 5th house, which\\nprimarily deals with children. While a problem with adolescents is\\nindicated, it need not be a significant issue. The lowest number is\\nonly an indication for you or your astrologer to conduct a more\\ndetailed investigation in that particular house. As you dig deep, the\\ndepth and significance of the problem will become clear.\\nSimilarly, if the lowest score is in the 9th house, it makes sense to\\ninvestigate there. The 9th house deals with several important\\naspects of a native\\'s life. But the most important factor of the 9th\\nhouse is about the father or the head of the family. So, a low score\\nhere could mean that the native\\'s father may have died at an early\\nage or had health issues.\\nAnother relevant point to note about Ashtakavarga charts is that they\\nshould not be used by themselves or separately to make predictions.\\nIt is critical to check other astrology factors, including the pertinent\\ndivisional charts, planetary strengths, etc. to interpret a native\\'s life\\nand life experiences correctly. But this table can be a powerful\\nindicator of where to begin the investigation and find answers to\\nother questions likely to arise as you verify various angles of a\\nnative\\'s horoscope.\\nHere are more points about the Ashtakavarga table that will help you\\nmake good predictions:\\nIf the number in the first house or Lagna is low and is also less than\\n25, then it means the native needs other people\\'s support to do his\\nor her work. This individual cannot do his or her karma by himself or\\nherself. Such individuals always need somebody with them and\\ncannot survive without a partner.\\nIf the first house has a high score, then such people enjoy working\\nalone. Such individuals are likely to have high egos, although they\\ncan make correct decisions with little help from others. People with a\\n\\nhigh score in the Lagna generally succeed, provided the other\\nplanetary positions are promising.\\nIf the 12th house score is low, such individuals also have a good life\\nbecause opportunities for loss and suffering are likely to be few. If\\nthe 12th score is the lowest, then such individuals are misers. They\\neither don\\'t have the mindset or the opportunity to spend money.\\nIf the score of your 11th house (house of gains) is greater than that\\nof your 12th house (house of loss), then too, it is good because it\\nmeans you will gain more than you lose. If the condition is reversed,\\nthat is to say, the score in your 12th house is greater than that of\\nyour 11th house, then you are likely to spend more than you gain or\\nearn.\\n\\nCase Study of Ashtakavarga Table Scores\\nLet us take these scores of an Ashtakavarga table:\\n1st house - 25, 2nd house - 28, 3rd house - 33, 4th house - 29, 5th\\nhouse - 26, 6th house - 24, 7th house - 35, 8th house - 35, 9th house\\n- 26, 10th house - 27, 11th house - 22, and 12th house - 27. If you\\nnotice, the total score is 337. Let’s interpret these scores:\\n•   The average score is 337/12 = 28, which is also taken as a\\nthreshold. So, less than 28 is a bad score, and over 28 is a\\ngood score. This is the reason 25 to 30 is taken as average\\nscores.\\n•   In the above case study, the 1st, 5th, 6th, 9th, 10th, 11th, and\\n12th houses have scored less than 28. The 3rd, 4th, 7th, and\\n8th houses are of good value. The 2nd house with a value of 28\\nis average.\\n•   Any house with a score of less than 25 is bad. Here, the 9th\\nand the 11th houses are quite bad, the 11th being very bad.\\nValues of the 1st, 9th, 10th, and 11th houses are also less than\\n30, which means they are negative indicators.\\n•   The Lagna and the 4th houses also have less than 30.\\n•   The value of 25 in the 1st house means that the native will\\nboost his or her life after 25 years of age.\\n•   The value of the 2nd house is 28, which is greater than the\\n11th and 12th houses\\' values. This means that the native will\\nnot waste their earnings and money.\\n•   But the value of his 12th house is greater than the value of\\nhis 11th house, which means the native cannot hold on to his\\nsavings/earnings. This person\\'s expenditure will be more than\\nhis or her income/earnings/savings.\\nHouses 1, 5, and 9 represent Bandhu, and the total for this native is\\n77\\nHouses 2, 6, and 10 represent Sevaka, and the total is 79\\nHouses 3, 7, and 11 represent Poshaka; the total value is 90\\nHouses 4, 8, and 12 represent Ghataka; the total value is 91\\nIf the Bandhu group has the highest tally, then the native will have\\nample resources, will do good karma, and be charitable. If the\\n\\nSevaka group has the highest tally, then the native will be in\\nemployment or service, and he or she will be money-minded. If the\\nPoshaka group gets the highest tally, then the native may be an\\nindustrialist, employer, or a boss. If the Ghataka group has the\\nhighest tally, then the native could be very poor.\\nIt takes time and effort to understand and interpret the Ashtakavarga\\ntable. But, when used with the other astrological tools and\\ntechniques mentioned in this book, it can be a powerfully accurate\\npredictor of horoscopes.\\n\\nConclusion\\nAt first glance, Vedic Astrology might appear confounding to the\\nnovice. It is easy to relate to this feeling of being overwhelmed by the\\ninformation this engrossing and captivating subject covers. Yes, it\\ndoes take a bit of effort on your part to understand the concepts of\\nJyotishya.\\nBut you can rest assured that your efforts will not be in vain. With\\nsustained and persistent practice and reading, you will learn to look\\nat a horoscope or table, use quick computations, and gauge what\\nlies in store for the native.\\nKnowing Jyotishya is useful for your own life. When you achieve\\ngreat success, you can review your own horoscope and know that\\nyou are not doing this on your own. You will learn that your past\\nkarmas are giving you beneficial outcomes. When you suffer a lot,\\nagain, simply reading your horoscope will give you an insight as to\\nhow long you must endure the difficult times.\\nViewing the happy and sad parts of your life with equanimity will\\nkeep you grounded and empower you to give your best shot to\\neverything you try. For such individuals, successes will far\\noutnumber the failures. So, go ahead, and read the book again and\\nagain until you have mastered the basics. You can then move on to\\nadvanced levels.\\n\\nPart 2: Nakshatras\\nThe Ultimate Guide to the 27 Lunar\\nMansions of Vedic Astrology\\n\\nIntroduction\\nNakshatras are segments of the ecliptic through which the Moon\\npasses on its orbit around the Earth. Otherwise known as lunar\\nmansions, ancient cultures use them in their organization of the\\ncalendar. Simply put, Nakshatras are asterisms, constellations, or\\ngroups of stars that are fixed and immobile. Planets pass over them\\nas they move in their orbits.\\nThe ancient Indian sages who created the Vedic Astrology and\\nNakshatras system say these lunar mansions are the homes in\\nwhich the fruits of labor—or karma, in Sanskrit—are stored. The\\nstars of asterisms distribute karma in the present life.\\nAlthough more popular in Hindu Astrology, the concept of using stars\\nof asterisms was adopted in other parts of the world, too, including\\nthe Euphrates Valley of Mesopotamia, Babylonia, Egypt, Arabia, and\\nPerson.\\nThe history of the study of Nakshatras is not relevant in this book.\\nMore interesting is that by knowing about Nakshatras and their\\ninfluences on your life, you can know where your life is going, and\\npotentially, even find out why.\\nThis comprehensive publication on Nakshatras extensively covers\\nthe basic aspects of this fascinating topic. While it may take years of\\nlearning and practice to master this idea, it has been written in\\nsimple, easy-to-understand language, and is great for beginners who\\nwant to test the waters.\\nThe best part of the book is that it has all the latest trends in\\nNakshatras’ realm, along with the updated tools used to arrive at\\npredictions. The chapters have been arranged so you will learn the\\nsimplest topics first and develop into the progressively complex\\ntopics. It is best to start from the first topic to get an idea of each\\nchapter before moving on to the next. By the time you finish the\\nbook, your understanding of Nakshatras and their effects on human\\nlife will have exceeded your original expectations.\\n\\nSECTION ONE: The 27 Lunar Mansions\\n\\nChapter 1: Introduction to the 27 Lunar Mansions\\nNakshatra is a Sanskrit term relating to a house (mansion) of the\\nmoon—astrologically referred to as a lunar mansion. The term\\nNakshatra is used both in Indian astronomy and in Hindu or Vedic\\nAstrology. The moon’s ecliptic orbit around the Earth is divided into\\n27 sectors, each of which is a Nakshatra. Each Nakshatra’s name is\\nconnected to an important star or group of stars (asterism) in that\\nsector.\\nAccording to Vedic Astrology, in Sanskrit, Nakshatra translates to\\n“star,” and the 27 Nakshatras play an undeniably important role in\\nastrological calculations. As you may call it, the Zodiac—or the\\nheavens—was categorized into twelve Rashis or Zodiac Signs.\\nIndia’s ancient seers used a more accurate and detailed\\ncategorization of the heavens into 27 Nakshatras or asterisms.\\nThese 27 Nakshatras or constellations are about 300-400 light-years\\naway from the Earth. Vedic Astrology offers detailed descriptions\\nalong with accurate mathematical and astronomical calculations by\\nwhich a practitioner has a powerful predictive tool in their hand\\nbased on an individual’s Nakshatra at their birth.\\nAccording to ancient Vedic astrology, the starting point of the 27\\nNakshatras is “Kritika,” or the vernal equinox’s position. However,\\nmore recent compilations of Vedic Astrology take the starting point of\\nthe list of 27 Nakshatras as “Ashwini,” a point on the ecliptic that is\\ndirectly opposite to “Chitra,” the Sanskrit name for the star Spica.\\n“Ashwini” is the asterism connected to the modern constellation of\\nAries. The first Vedic Astrological text that lists these 27 Nakshatras\\nis Vedanga Jyotisha.\\nThe Hindu scriptures like the Mahabharata and Harivamsa credit the\\ncreation of the Nakshatras to Daksha, an important son of Lord\\nBrahma, the universe’s creator. The story of Daksha and how he is\\ncredited with creating the Nakshatra goes as follows:\\nLord Brahma, the creator of the universe, created Daksha,\\nKamadeva, Dharma, and Agni from his right thumb, heart, chest, and\\neyebrows, respectively. Daksha is portrayed as a fat man with a\\nprotruding belly and an ibex’s head with spiral horns. Daksha and his\\n\\nwife Prasuti had many daughters. He married 27 of them to\\nChandra, the Moon God.\\nInterestingly, Chandra was only keen on marrying one of Daksha’s\\ndaughters, Rohini, but Daksha requested the Moon God to marry\\nanother 26, along with Rohini. Thus, the 27 wives of Chandra, the\\nMoon God, became the 27 Nakshatras or Lunar Mansions.\\nIn the Atharva Veda, one of the four Vedas in the Sanatana Dharma\\n—now known in the Western world as Hinduism—talks about 28\\nNakshatras, which are used as celestial markers in the sky. When\\nthese 28 stars were mapped into equal divisions of the ecliptic, it\\nresulted in 27 divisions. Those represented 27 cleaner and more\\naccurate segments, each subtending to 13° 20′ (13 degrees 20\\nminutes) instead of 12° 5 1-3/7′ (12 degrees and 1-3/7 minutes) in\\nthe earlier 28 sections.\\nThe 27 stars according to Vedic Astrology are Ashwini, Bharani,\\nKritika, Rohini, Mrigashirsha, Ardra, Punarvasu, Pushya, Aslesha,\\nMagha, Purva Phalguni, Uttara Phalguni, Hasta, Chitra, Swati,\\nVishakha, Anuradha, Jyeshtha, Moola, Purvashada, Uttarashada,\\nShravana, Dhanishta, Satabhisha, Purva Bhadrapada, Uttara\\nBhadrapada, and Revati.\\nThe Nakshatra Abhijit was left out from the 28 listed in the Atharva\\nVeda; however, rare astrological schools consider all 28 Nakshatras.\\nInterestingly, this abandoned Nakshatra Abhijit plays an important\\nrole while deciding auspicious times to conduct important events in\\nall schools of Vedic Astrology.\\n\\nRelationship Between Nakshatras and Zodiac\\nSigns\\nUnderstanding planetary rulers form a key element in Vedic\\nAstrology. In ancient Hindu Astrology, only the five visible planets,\\nnamely Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, along with the\\nSun and Moon, are the rulers of the twelve Zodiac Signs covering\\nthe 27 Nakshatras. These seven heavenly bodies together are\\nreferred to as the “Traditional Rulers.” The Sun and Moon rule one\\nZodiac sign each—Leo and Cancer, respectively—and the remaining\\nfive visible planets rule two signs each. In addition to the Traditional\\nRulers, Rahu and Ketu (Lunar Nodes) also rule certain Nakshatras.\\nAnother important point to note is that Zodiac signs also have their\\nown lords, taken from the nine rulers described above. Every\\nNakshatra is ruled by its own lord and gets influenced by the lord of\\nthe sign to which it belongs.\\nThe above 27 Nakshatras start at Ashwini at 0 degrees, and each of\\nthe Nakshatras covers 13 degrees, 20 minutes in 360 degrees of the\\npath. Further, each of these Nakshatras is divided into four quarters\\n(Padas) measuring 3 degrees, 20 minutes. The twelve Rashis\\ncovers 30 degrees each in the 360-degree path. The first Rashi or\\nthe Zodiac sign, namely Mesha—which covers 0-30 degrees—has\\nten padas of the first three Nakshatras as follows:\\n● All the four padas of the first Nakshatra, Ashwini (13 degrees,\\n20 minutes)\\n● All the four padas of the second Nakshatra, Bharani (13\\ndegrees, 20 minutes)\\n● The first pada of the third Nakshatra, Kritika (3 degrees, 20\\nminutes)\\nSo, the next Rashi, Vrishabh, will have the following Nakshatra\\npadas covered in it:\\n● The second, third, and the fourth pada of third Nakshatra,\\nKritika (10 degrees)\\n● All the four padas of the fourth Nakshatra, Rohini (13\\ndegrees, 20 minutes)\\n\\n● The first and second padas of the fifth Nakshatra,\\nMrigasheersha (6 degrees, 40 minutes)\\nLike this, each of the twelve Rashis encloses nine padas from the\\nvarious Nakshatras, taken in order.\\nNow, look at each of these Nakshatras in more detail.\\n\\nThe 27 Nakshatras\\nAshwini – The Ashwini Nakshatra ranges from 0 degrees to 13\\ndegrees, 20 minutes in the Mesha Rashi or the Aries sign.

Due to their mixed nature, these asterisms are\\ngood for routine activities such as worshipping, purchasing\\nelectronics and furniture, and fire ceremonies.\\n\\nChapter 2: A Closer Look at Nakshatras\\nChapter 1 provided basic information about each Nakshatra. Chapter\\n2 takes a closer look at each of the 27 Nakshatras. However, before\\nthat, there are other preliminary and very important elements in\\nVedic Astrology that you need to be aware of.\\n\\nThe Three Gunas\\nIndian philosophy divides reality into two categories: Purusha, the\\nknower, and Prakriti, the known. Purusha or the Self is never an\\nexperiential object; it is always the subject matter. Purusha is that\\nwhich knows everything and is totally aware. On the other hand,\\nPrakriti is all that shows itself, including material and psychological\\nelements. Prakriti consists of everything that can be known.\\nPrakriti is a gigantic reservoir of limitless potential or energy made up\\nof three primary forces or gunas, which include Sattva, Rajas, and\\nTamas. Each of these gunas has its own characteristics. Knowing\\nhow these three gunas work and understanding their essence is an\\nimportant tool on the spiritual path. It also plays an important role in\\nVedic Astrology. Now, look at each of these three gunas—which\\ntranslates to “strand” or “fiber”—in more detail.\\nSattva – Sattva behaves like a transparent glass, allowing the light\\nand knowledge of the pure consciousness to flow through easily. It\\nhas the power to unveil the ultimate truth—or Sat in Sanskrit. Sattva\\nmanifests through inspiration, beauty, and balance and promotes\\nhealth, contentment, and energy. Sattva is the energy connected to\\nliberation. It goes beyond the materialistic world and yearns to return\\nto its original, heavenly abode.\\nRajas – This fundamental force of Prakriti is related to change and is\\ncharacterized by passion, effort, desire, and pain. The activity of\\nRajas can drive you toward Sattva (increased spirituality) or Tamas\\n(increased desire for materialism). Although it can have positive or\\nnegative outcomes, Rajas is characterized by unsteadiness,\\nagitation, and unhappiness.\\nTamas – This fundamental force or energy layer of Prakriti hides the\\npresence of Pure Consciousness. The power of Tamas to obscure\\nresults in dullness and ignorance. This fundamental force is heavy\\nand dense. Interestingly, another synonym of Tamas is “sthithi,” or\\nbeing steady. Tamas, in a Sattvic form, can have a steadying\\ninfluence in one’s life. For example, resting during illness can be\\ntherapeutic.\\nTamas is almost always characterized by immobilization. Therefore,\\ntamasic foods are impure, stale, and lifeless. Tamasic entertainment\\n\\nis intoxicating and mindless. All things from Tamas invariably leads\\nto inaction even when action is the need of the hour. The attraction\\nto lethargy, sleep, and procrastination is a common tamasic effect\\nthat nearly everyone experiences. Tamas is all about the material\\nworld.\\n\\nNakshatras and the Three Gunas\\nEach of the 27 Nakshatras represents the three gunas in three\\ndifferent ways or levels. Now, look at each of the three levels to\\nunderstand the connection between gunas and Nakshatras better.\\nFirst-Level Relationship – The 27 Nakshatras are divided into three\\ncategories, each with nine Nakshatras representing one of the three\\nfundamental forces. Thus, at a primary level:\\n● Nine of the 27 Nakshatras representing Rajas energy\\ncoincide with the Zodiac Signs Aries, Taurus, Gemini, and\\nCancer.\\n● Another group of nine Nakshatras representing Tamas\\nenergy coincides with the Zodiac Signs Leo, Virgo, Libra, and\\nScorpio.\\n● The third group of nine Nakshatras representing Sattva\\nenergy coincides with the Zodiac signs Sagittarius, Capricorn,\\nAquarius, and Pisces.\\nSecond-Level Relationship – Each group of nine Nakshatras is\\nfurther divided into three groups of three Nakshatras, each at the\\nsecondary level. So, the nine Nakshatras representing Rajas energy\\nat the primary level are divided as follows:\\n● The first three Nakshatras represent Rajas at the secondary\\nlevel.\\n● The next three represent Tamas at the secondary level.\\n● The last three represent Sattva at the secondary level.\\nSimilarly, the nine Nakshatras representing Tamas energy are\\ndivided into three groups as follows at the secondary level:\\n● The first three Nakshatras represent Rajas energy.\\n● The second three Nakshatras represent Tamas energy.\\n● The last three Nakshatras represent Sattva energy.\\nIn the same way, the nine Nakshatras representing Sattva energy\\nare divided into three groups as follows:\\n● The first three Nakshatras represent Rajas energy.\\n● The second three Nakshatras represent Tamas energy.\\n● The last three Nakshatras represent Sattva energy.\\n\\nTertiary-Level Relationship – Each of the three Nakshatras at the\\nsecondary level is further divided into three categories, each\\nrepresenting Rajas, Tamas, and Sattva energies. With this system,\\nthe 27 Nakshatras and the three fundamental energies interacting\\nwith each other along with their respective planetary lords are as\\nfollows:\\n1. Ashwini – Rajas-Rajas-Rajas – Ketu\\n2. Bharani – Rajas-Rajas-Tamas – Venus (or Shukra)\\n3. Krittika – Rajas-Rajas-Sattva – Sun (Surya)\\n4. Rohini – Rajas-Tamas-Rajas – Moon (Chandra)\\n5. Mrigashirsha – Rajas-Tamas-Tamas – Mars (Guja)\\n6. Ardra – Rajas-Tamas-Sattva – Rahu\\n7. Punarvasu – Rajas-Sattva-Rajas – Jupiter (Guru)\\n8. Pushya – Rajas-Sattva-Tamas – Saturn (Shani)\\n9. Ashlesha – Rajas-Sattva-Sattva – Mercury (Bhuddh)\\n10. Magha – Tamas-Rajas-Rajas – Ketu\\n11. Purva Phalguni – Tamas-Rajas-Tamas – Venus (Shukra)\\n12. Uttara Phalguni – Tamas-Rajas-Sattva – Sun (Surya)\\n13. Hasta – Tamas-Tamas-Rajas – Moon (Chandra)\\n14. Chitra – Tamas-Tamas-Tamas – Mars (Guja)\\n15. Swati – Tamas-Tamas-Sattva – Rahu\\n16. Vishakha – Tamas-Sattva-Rajas – Jupiter (Guru)\\n17. Anuradha – Tamas-Sattva-Tamas – Saturn (Shani)\\n18. Jyeshta – Tamas-Sattva-Sattva – Mercury (Buddh)\\n19. Mula – Sattva-Rajas-Rajas – Ketu\\n20. Purvashadha – Sattva-Rajas-Tamas – Venus (Shukra)\\n21. Uttarashadha – Sattva-Rajas-Sattva – Sun (Surya)\\n22. Shravana – Sattva-Tamas-Rajas – Moon (Chandra)\\n23. Dhanistha – Sattva-Tamas-Tamas – Mars (Guja)\\n24. Shatabhisha – Sattva-Tamas-Sattva – Rahu\\n25. Purva Bhadrapada – Sattva-Sattva-Rajas – Jupiter (Guru)\\n26. Uttara Bhadrapada – Sattva-Sattva-Tamas – Saturn (Shani)\\n27. Revati – Sattva-Sattva-Sattva – Mercury (Bhuddh)\\n\\nConnection Between Lords of the Nakshatras\\nand the Gunas\\nThe lords of the Nakshatras play an important role in the life of a\\nperson. The lord of the Nakshatra, in which the Moon is placed at the\\ntime of a person’s birth, determines the first “dasa” of the individual’s\\nlife. Dasas and their importance will be detailed later. Interestingly, a\\ncritical connection can be found between the lords of the Nakshatras\\nand the gunas.\\n● Ketu, Shukra, and Surya are the lords of those Nakshatras\\nwith Rajas at the secondary level.\\n● Chandra, Guja, and Rahu are the lords of the Nakshatras\\nwith Tamas at the secondary level.\\n● Guru, Shani, and Bhuddh are the lords of the Nakshatras with\\nSattva at the secondary level.\\nNow, look at the tertiary level.\\n● Shukra, Guja, and Shani are the lords of the Nakshatras that\\nhave Tamas at the tertiary level.\\n● Surya, Rahu, and Bhuddh are the Nakshatras lords with\\nSattva at the tertiary level.\\n● Ketu, Chandra, and Guru are the lords of those Nakshatras\\nthat have Rajas at the tertiary level.\\nLooking at the secondary and tertiary levels, you get the following\\ninformation about the nine planets and the gunas.\\n● Ketu – Rajas-Rajas\\n● Shukra (Venus) – Rajas-Tamas\\n● Surya (Sun) – Rajas-Sattva\\n● Chandra (Moon) – Tamas-Rajas\\n● Guja (Mars) – Tamas-Tamas\\n● Rahu – Tamas-Sattva\\n● Guru (Jupiter) – Sattva-Rajas\\n● Shani (Saturn) – Sattva-Tamas\\n● Bhuddh (Mercury) – Sattva-Sattva\\nNow, you can draw some really fascinating connections between the\\nplanets and the gunas with examples.\\n\\n● Venus (Shukra) is known for love and lust. To get love and\\nlust, you take action (Rajas), and the deeper you get into\\naction, the more you fall into ignorance (Tamas).\\n● Surya is a fiery (Rajas) planet, but it also represents the soul\\nand has Sattva characteristics.\\n● Guru is also a fiery (Rajas) planet. However, again, Guru\\nrepresents inner wisdom and is Sattvic.\\n● Saturn is a spiritual (Sattva) planet because it is related to\\nSannyas (renouncement). But Saturn also represents matter\\n(or material), which is why it has Tamasic characteristics.\\n● Rahu is like Shani but in the reverse order. Rahu takes you\\nso deep into materialistic life that you accept everything that\\nthis life has to give you and then follow the path of liberation\\n(Sattva).\\n● Bhuddh (Mercury) comes across as the most spiritual planet\\n—and the reason is clear. It is an airy planet and has the power\\nto liberate you from suffering. Unlike animals, human beings\\ncan think for themselves. Mercury helps you do that. It is\\nneither connected to Tamas (materialism) nor Rajas (activity). It\\nmerely thinks about these two without going into either of the\\ntwo.\\n\\nPadas and Navamsas\\nAs you already know, every Nakshatra is divided into four padas of 3\\ndegrees, 30 minutes each. A Navamsa chart is used to depict the\\npadas of Nakshatras. Nav-amsa means the “nine parts” or divisions\\nof a Zodiac Sign. Each Zodiac sign has nine padas in it, making it a\\ntotal of 108 padas in the entire elliptic. A Navamsa chart is\\nconsidered the most important divisional charts—or Varga charts—to\\nmake predictive readings of an individual’s life.\\nIt has to be read in conjunction with the fundamental natal—or Rashi\\n—chart. If the natal chart is compared to a blueprint, the Navamsa\\nchart shows what that blueprint can become. Every pada is\\nexpressed through one of the twelve Navamsa signs and the ruling\\nlord of that particular sign. Every pada alternates with male and\\nfemale expressions, as do the twelve Zodiac Signs. Padas are\\ndiscussed further in the next chapter.\\n\\nThe 27 Nakshatras and their Dileanations\\nNow, look at each of the 27 Nakshatras in more detail.\\nAshwini – The Ashwini Nakshatra represents the Ashwini Kumara\\ntwins named Castor and Pullox. Spanning from 0 degrees to13\\ndegrees, 20 minutes in Aries or Mesha Rashi, Ashwini’s ruling planet\\nis Ketu. The element connected to Ashwini is earth, and its symbol is\\nthe head of a horse.\\nThe Ashwini Kumaras, the physicians to the gods or devas, rule over\\nthis constellation. This constellation can help people be free of\\ndiseases and deliver miraculous cures. People born in this\\nNakshatra are usually popular, good-looking, skillful, intelligent, and\\nlove all decorative elements.\\nThe character of Ashwini Nakshatra is light and swift and is good for\\nundertaking journeys, starting treatments, beginning a study course,\\nmaking and manufacturing jewelry, and enjoying luxurious items.\\nBharani – The ruler of Bharani is Lord Yama, the god of death, who\\nhas the power to take things away—referred to as apabharani shakti.\\nSo, Bharani Nakshatra takes away those things that have completed\\ntheir life term on Earth and moves them to the next world. Lord Yama\\ntakes the soul of the person who has completed their life on Earth\\nand takes it to the astral plane, where the soul can experience the\\neffects of its karma of the present world and prepare itself for the\\nnext world or birth.\\nLord Yama stands for discipline, sacrifice, cleanliness, purity,\\nintegrity, and justice. The Nakshatra, over which this lord rules also,\\nis a giver of what is good, truthful, pure, and honest. Bharani\\nNakshatra’s astrological nature is fierce and cruel. It is suitable for\\ngetting jobs done immediately, competitions, cruel deeds, and tasks\\nrelated to poison, fire, and dangerous chemicals. Bharani Nakshatra\\nis not suitable to start any auspicious events or work.\\nBharani is connected to the earth element, and Shukra is the ruler of\\nthis constellation. Natives of Bharani Nakshatra are usually\\nsuccessful in their professions, truthful, and are free from grief. They\\nwill have a resolute character and no health issues.\\nKrittika – The first pada falls in Mesha Rashi while the remaining\\nthree padas fall in the Vrishabha Rashi. The ruling lord of Krittika is\\n\\nAgni, and the ruling planet is Surya. The element of Krittika is the\\nearth, and the symbol is a goat. People born in the Krittika Nakshatra\\nare usually attractive, voracious eaters, famous, and known to have\\na roving eye.\\nThe lord of this Nakshatra is Agni, who has the power to burn,\\nreferred to as dahana shakti. The nature of Agni is to give light and\\nheat, which are important elements for purification. So, the power of\\nKrittika Nakshatra can burn up negativity, purifies a mixture of\\npositive and negative, and can cook or ripen uncooked and raw\\nthings.\\nKrittika Nakshatra’s nature is of mixed quality. It is an auspicious star\\nfor doing immediate actions, to start competitions, to work with\\nmetals, and to start an argument, but it is not an auspicious star to\\nbegin long-term, important tasks.\\nRohini – All the four padas of Rohini Nakshatra are in Vrishabha\\nRashi. Derived from the Sanskrit root, Rohan meaning rising or\\ncoming into existence, Rohini is the birth star of Lord Krishna.\\nAccording to Hindu mythology, Rohini was one of Chandra’s 27\\nwives, the one he loved the most. Chandra rules Rohini, and the\\nsymbol is a cow-drawn cart.\\nNatives of Rohini Nakshatra are usually truthful, do not covet others’\\nproperties, speak sweetly, have clean habits, good-looking, and have\\nfirm views. The lord of Rohini Nakshatra is Lord Brahma, the creator,\\nwhose power is to create or grow, referred to as rohana shakti.\\nRohini Nakshatra’s power lies in its ability to make anything fertile\\nand allow for growth and development.\\nPeople born in Rohini Nakshatra—who invariably live well and\\nabundantly—are also prone to jealous attacks from others. Yet,\\nthese are only side effects of the power of achieving great prosperity.\\nBeing a steady and fixed Nakshatra, Rohini is auspicious for laying\\nthe foundations for cities, towns, digging wells, planting trees,\\ncoronations, building temples, installing deities, and other such\\nactivities that have lasting effects.\\nMrigashirsha – The first and second padas of Mrigashirsha is in\\nVrishabha Rashi, and the third and fourth padas are in Mithuna\\nRashi. The ruling planet of this Nakshatra is Mangala or Mars, and\\n\\nthe ruling lord is Chandra. The symbol of Mrigashirsha is the\\nantelope.\\nPeople born in Mrigashirsha Nakshatra are usually skillful, good\\nspeakers, knowledgeable, and rich, but also cowardly and\\ncapricious. They are quite timid and peace-loving. The lord of\\nMrigashirsha is Chandra, also called Soma—the nectar of\\nimmortality)—the Moon God. Soma renders prana Shakti—or\\nfulfillment. Chandra in Mrigashirsha also stands for weaving and\\nexpansion. So, Mrigashirsha Nakshatra has the power to fill their\\nlives and those of others with joy and fulfillment.\\nMrigashirsa is an auspicious star for accepting initiation, weddings,\\nbuilding constructions, and undertaking journeys. It has a gentle and\\nsoft nature and is good for learning arts, sensual pleasures, wearing\\nnew clothes, festivities, and other joyful events.\\nArdra – All the four padas of Ardra Nakshatra are in Mithuna Rashi.\\nThe ruling lord of this Nakshatra is Rudra—a form of Lord Shiva—\\nthe trident and bow wielder. Ardra is the Janma Nakshatra of Lord\\nShiva. The ruling planet is Rahu, and the symbol is a teardrop.\\nNatives born under the Ardra Nakshatra are typically skillful traders\\nand are highly interested in Tantric rituals. On the flip side, these\\nnatives can be quite ungrateful, have a fierce temper, and indulge in\\nwicked deeds.\\nLord Rudra represents thunder and is the fiercest form of Lord Shiva.\\nHis power lies in putting effort—yatna Shakti—into making gains in\\nlife. Hunting, searching, and achieving goals are the basis of yatna\\nshakti. Ardra Nakshatra calls upon one to work hard and persistently\\nto achieve their goals.\\nThe Ardra Nakshatra is good if you need to fight off rivals and\\nenemies, start tasks associated with fire, and for ghost hunting.\\nConsidering the fiercely destructible nature of Ardra Nakshatra, it is\\nhighly suitable for warfares, to invoke elemental spirits, and for acts\\nof destruction.\\nPunarvasu – The first three padas of Punarvasu is in Mithuna\\nRashi, and the last pada is in Karkata Rashi. The ruling of this\\nNakshatra is Aditi, the Mother Goddess or the devas’ mother, and\\n\\nthe ruling planet is Guru (Jupiter). The element connected to\\nPunarvasu is water.\\nPeople born in this constellation are typically morally and religiously\\ngood but can be quite dull and sickly. It would be easy to please\\npeople born in this Nakshatra with even small gifts. They are usually\\na fast walker.\\nPunarvasu is ruled by the Mother Goddess, known for Her power to\\ngain materialistic wealth and prosperity—referred to as vasutva\\nprapana shakti. She grants abundance to the earth and combines\\nthe power of rain or water and air or wind. So, this Nakshatra is great\\nfor revitalizing plant life. The power of Punarvasu renews and\\nrevitalizes creativity.\\nPushya – All the four padas of Pushya Nakshatra are in Karkata\\nRashi (Cancer). Its ruling planet is Shani, and the ruling lord is\\nBrihaspati, the guru of the devas. It is related to the water element,\\nand the symbol is a cow’s teat. Pushya translates to mean nourish,\\npreserve, protect, multiple, strengthen, and replenish. Goddess\\nLakshmi and Goddess Sita are Pushya Nakshatra natives. People\\nborn in Pushya Nakshatra are usually learned, popular, rich,\\ncharitable, have control over their passions, adventurous, and lustful.\\nThey could be short.\\nThe lord of Pushya Nakshatra is Brihaspati, who is believed to be the\\ngod of divine wisdom. He can create spiritual energy—referred to as\\nbrahmavarchas shakti. He stands for worshippers and sacrificial\\nworship, both of which are important elements for creating spiritual\\nenergy.\\nHe is also the lord of speech, specifically prayer, and all forms of\\nworship, including meditation. Pushya Nakshatra enhances good\\nkarma and the outcomes of hard work. This Nakshatra is extremely\\nauspicious to start religious and spiritual practices.\\nAshlesha – All the four padas of Ashlesha Nakshatra are in Karkata\\nRashi. The twin brothers, Lakshman and Shatrughna in Valmiki\\nRamayana, were natives of this Nakshatra. The ruling planet is\\nMercury, and the element connected to it is water. The symbol of\\nAshlesha Nakshatra is a coiled snake.\\n\\nPeople born in Aslesha Nakshatra can turn out to be cruel and\\nungrateful. They pay little attention to the work of other people and\\ncan be addicted to various vices. The ruling deity of this Nakshatra is\\nthe serpent god who can inflict poison (visasleshana shakti). The\\nserpent god is also connected to trembling and agitation, and these\\npowers can destroy victims.\\nWhile this power is good to drop harmful enemies, it can make the\\nnatives highly temperamental. Interestingly, serpents are also\\nconnected with using practical wisdom, through which one can\\novercome enemies and other obstacles in their life path.\\nMagha – All the four padas of Magha Nakshatra are in Simha Rashi\\n(Leo Zodiac). Its ruling planet is Ketu, and its ruling deity is\\n“pitrugan.” The symbol of Magha Nakshatra is a royal court with a\\nthrone. It is associated with the water element.\\nPeople born in Magha Nakshatra are usually wealthy and have many\\nservants to do their bidding. They respect elders and gods and are\\nalso very enterprising. Ruled by the “pitrugan” or ancestors, this\\nNakshatra reflects the power of leaving or giving up one’s body—\\nreferred to as tyage kshepani shakti. It also represents mourning.\\nBoth these characteristic features stand for death or the end of a\\nparticular cycle.\\nMagha Nakshatra is like Bharani Nakshatra, as the latter also\\nrepresents the soul’s movement away from one’s body. Another\\nmeaning of Magha Nakshatra is related to ancestors and one’s pride\\nin ancestral legacy.\\nThis constellation has a cruel and fierce nature and is suitable to\\nundertake tasks related to conflict, deceit, destroying one’s enemies,\\nbattling and fighting, and other unkind acts. Magha Nakshatra is\\nunsuitable for the start of auspicious activities.\\nPurva Phalguni – All the four padas of Purva Phalguni Nakshatra\\nare in Simha Rashi.

According to Taittiriya Brahmanas, Purva Phalguni is ruled\\nby Aryaman, the God of unions and contracts, who has the power of\\nprocreation—referred to as prajanana shakti. The other qualities of\\nthis Nakshatra are those connected with female and male partners.\\nThese powers of Purva Phalguni stand for the union and\\nprocreations at all levels of human life, but as Aryaman is the ruler of\\nproductive alliances, Purva Phalguni union and procreating powers\\nhave approved social and familial agreements.\\nUttara Phalguni – The first pada of Uttara Phalguni is in Simha\\nRashi, and the remaining three padas are in Kanya Rashi.

They have the power to subdue their\\nenemies and enjoy all the pleasures of life, including being versed in\\nthe arts, association with women, and more.\\nBhaga, the god of happiness, is related to the power of accumulating\\nprosperity—referred to as chayani shakti—through unions and\\nmarriages. Bhaga’s power deals with wealth accumulated from one’s\\nown family and wealth derived from the partner’s family. So, Uttara\\nPhalguni represents prosperity through unions and marriages.\\nHasta – All the four padas are in Kanya Rashi (Virgo Zodiac). Its\\nruling deity is Surya, and its symbol is a closed hand.

As you already know, each\\nNakshatra has four padas. The four padas stand for four elements,\\nnamely:\\n● The first pada is Agni because it is mapped to Agni Navamsa\\n● The second pada is Prithvi – mapped to Prithvi Navamsa\\n● The third pada is Vayu\\n● The fourth pada is Jala\\nThese padas also represent Dharma (Agni), Artha (Prithvi), Kama\\n(Vayu), and Moksha (Jala). The four padas are like the four legs of a\\ncow. Each Nakshatra represents a cow. The bull is represented by\\nthe Moon, who visits each Nakshatra from the first to the fourth\\npada, collectively representing Dharma.\\nDuring the Satya Yuga, all four legs of Dharma were strong. During\\nthe Dwapara Yuga, three were strong, during the Treta Yuga, two\\nwere strong, and now, during the Kali Yuga, only one leg of Dharma\\nis strong. So, during the Kali Yuga, it is not just enough to see the\\nJanma Nakshatra but also the pada in which the native was born\\nbecause only one pada is strong. The rest of the padas are weak.\\nHere is an example to explain how padas affect natives born in the\\nsame Nakshatra. Suppose a person’s Janma Nakshatra is Ashwini,\\nfirst pada. Now, this pada is the Agni pada, which stands for\\nDharma. So, for this person, Dharma will have a high focus in their\\nlife because the other padas, namely Artha, Kama, and Moksha, will\\nbe weak.\\nSimilarly, suppose the native was born in the second pada of\\nAshwini Nakshatra. Then, Artha will be strong for them, and the\\nother three will be weak. Again, if the native is born in Ashwini\\nNakshatra, the third pada, the Kama aspect will be strong because\\nthe others will be weak. For a person born in the fourth pada,\\nMoksha’s focus will be strong, and the other three will be weak. That\\n\\nis why it is important to focus on the pada and the Nakshatra to\\narrive at an accurate birth chart.\\n\\nThe First Nine Nakshatras – Janma Nakshatras\\nThe 27 Nakshatras are divided into nine sets of three Nakshatras\\neach. Everyone has a Janma Nakshatra or the Birth Star. It is the\\nconstellation in which the Moon was passing through at the time of\\none’s birth. Janma Nakshatra is the primary driver of personal\\nperceptions, behaviors, prejudices, and instincts and significantly\\nimpacts lives.\\nJanma Nakshatra governs the realities and experiences of life and\\nthe way one’s mind works. Every constellation has a unique\\npersonality composed of likes, dislikes, skill sets, and more. Each\\nNakshatra has its strengths and weaknesses. None are perfect.\\nEvery Janma Nakshatra has two corresponding constellations linked\\nto it, referred to as Anujanma Nakshatra and Trijanma Nakshatra.\\nFor example, if you are born in the first Nakshatra, namely Ashwini,\\nthis becomes your Janma Nakshatra. Your Anujanma Nakshatra will\\nbe the tenth constellation from Ashwini, namely Makam, and your\\nTrijanma Nakshatra will be the nineteenth constellation, Moolam.\\nIn the same way, each of the 27 Nakshatras has Anujanma and\\nTrijanma Nakshatras linked to it. Here is a list of the first nine\\nconstellations. The first column is the Janma Nakshatra, the second\\ncolumn is the Anujanma Nakshatra, and the third column is the\\nTrijanma Nakshatra.\\nAshwini – Makam – Moolam\\nBharani – Purva Phalguni – Purvashada\\nKrittika – Uttara Phalguni – Uttarashada\\nRohini – Hastha – Shravana\\nMrigashirsha – Chitra – Dhanishta\\nArdra – Swathi – Satabhishtha\\nPunarvasu – Vishakha – Purva Bhadrapada\\nPushya – Anuradha – Uttara Bhadrapada\\nAshlesha – Jyeshtha – Revati\\nSo, the first nine Nakshatras’ Anujanma and Trijanma are listed here.\\nNow, suppose your Janma Nakshatra is in the second column of the\\nsecond set of nine Nakshatras. Then, your Anujanma and Trijanma\\n\\nNakshatras will be the ones listed in the third and first columns,\\nrespectively.\\nFor example, if your Janma Nakshatra is Hashtha, your Anujanma\\nNakshatra will be Shravana, and your Trijanma Nakshatra will be\\nRohini. Similarly, if your Janma Nakshatra is Purvashada, your\\nAnujanma and Trijanma Nakshatras will be Bharani and Purva\\nPhalguni, respectively. This chapter deals with the first Nakshatras or\\nthe first planetary group.\\nEvery Nakshatra has a symbol assigned to it by the ancient rishis.\\nEach of the symbols and glyphs refers to a particular aspect of\\nhuman experience connected to the Nakshatra.

The\\nAnujanma Nakshatra demonstrates the potency or ability of a native\\nto analyze, execute, and achieve the present’s karma as connected\\nwith the past. The planets of the Anujamna Nakshatra should not be\\ninimical with the planets of the Janma Nakshatra.\\nFor example, if a native has Saturn in their Lagna or the house of the\\nplanet of their birth star, and Mars is in the fourth-star house from\\ntheir Lagna, the chances of such individuals to make rash and wrong\\ndecisions are high. This happens because Mars and Saturn are\\ninimical, with one in the Janma Nakshatra and the other in the\\nAnujanma Nakshatra.\\n\\nChapter 5: Trijanma Nakshatras: The Last\\nNakshatra Group\\nThe last group of Nakshatras forming the Trijanma Nakshatras for\\nthe first group include Moola, Purvashada, Uttarashada, Shravana,\\nDhanishta, Shatabishtha, Purva Bhadrapada, Uttara Bhadrapada,\\nand Revati.\\nMoola\\nLocated in the Dhanush Rashi (Sagittarius) from 0 degrees to 13\\ndegrees, 20 seconds, Moola Nakshatra stands for “root” or “center”\\nand is often referred to as the “root star.” This Nakshatra represents\\nthe galactic center.

It could be\\nused to stoke the fire to keep the passion alive or to cool off the fire,\\nwhich means to survive adversity, as a decorative item (standing for\\nart and crafts), or as a symbol of mystery by hiding one’s face behind\\nthe fan.\\nUttarashada\\nRanging from 26 degrees, 20 seconds in Dhanush Rashi up to 10\\ndegrees in Makar Rashi (Capricorn), Uttarashada’s symbol is a tusk.\\nIts glyph is represented by two elephant tusks crossing over each\\nother on a pyramid, rising from between the tusks.

This\\nNakshatra ranges from 10 degrees to 23 degrees, 20 seconds in\\nMakar Rashi, and it stands for not only listening to others but also\\nlistening to one’s inner voice.\\nIts glyph is represented by the full moon, its ruling planet, supported\\nunderneath by a crescent moon. Three uneven straight lines emerge\\nfrom the circumference of the full moon. The three straight lines have\\na small circle at their ends. The small circles represent the “three\\nuneven steps” connected to Shravana. The three lines represent the\\nconnection between the speaker and the listener.\\nShravana is a masculine star, and its animal symbol is a monkey.\\nShravana is believed to be the “star of learning” and has a deep\\nconnection to Goddess Saraswati and Lord Vishnu in his dwarf form.\\nShravana stands for understanding and communication of that\\nknowledge, which helps people to transcend the material world.\\nUnder its influence, people are usually wise and intelligent.

They are artistic and inclined to music and\\ndance, but like the drum—its symbol—natives tend to be hollow and\\nare continually looking for external things to fill this emptiness, an\\nattitude that makes them highly self-absorbed.\\nShatabhisha\\nRanging from 6 degrees, 40 seconds to 20 degrees in Kumbha\\nRashi, Shatabhisha’s symbol is 1,000 stars. Shatabhisha stands for\\na “hundred healers.” Its glyph is an empty circle from which four\\nlightning bolts emerge, representing the presence of electricity in\\neverything. Two small circles adorn the top and bottom of the circular\\nglyph. These little circles represent electrons going around the\\natomic nucleus.\\nFrom above, the glyph of Shatabhisha looks like a turtle with its four\\nlimbs outstretched.

They are caregivers too. Being the last\\nNakshatra, Revati indicates the final journey, from this world to the\\nnext.\\n\\nDifferent Types of Karma\\nKarma is a supremely important element in Hinduism. A simple\\ndefinition of karma is that it represents the fruits of one’s past and\\npresent actions, which, in turn, impact the fruits of the future. The\\nliteral translation of “karma” is action in Sanskrit. There are typically\\nthree types of karma:\\n● Sanchita Karma\\n● Prarabdha Karma\\n● Aagami Karma\\nSanchita Karma – This baggage of karma is accumulated past\\nactions waiting to come to fruition. Sanchita is like a storehouse that\\nholds all the actions of your past lifetimes. It is a collection of\\nunresolved karmas waiting to achieve resolution status.\\nPrarabdha Karma – This karma is what you are doing now, in this\\nlifetime, and the fruits of your present actions.\\nAgami Karma – Future actions resulting from your current karma\\nare collectively referred to as Agami Karma. Resolving and\\nmitigating past karma create new karmas that may or may not be\\nresolved in this lifetime. The results of the current karmas carried\\ninto the future are referred to as Agami Karma.\\nThe Janma Nakshatra, Anujanma Nakshatra, and the Trijanma\\nNakshatra are rooted in your past and present karmas. Of all the\\nplanets, Rahu and Ketu are considered the most closely associated\\nwith karmas and their fruitions. The ancient Vedic seers categorized\\nthese two shadow planets as the most mysterious heavenly bodies\\nthat profoundly affect people’s lives, depending on their karmas,\\nbased on which they posit themselves on their birth chart.\\nEvery one of the seven planets with a physical presence affects and\\ninfluences your present life on Earth. On the other hand, Rahu and\\nKetu are believed to be “invisible” energy forms that can access\\nkarmas from past lives, namely the Sanchita Karmas.\\nKetu is considered the oldest planet as he existed even at the time of\\ncataclysms of nature. Therefore, all your past lives’ karmas are\\nrecorded in Ketu’s registry. His records indicate the area in which\\nyou have been working during previous lifetimes. Rahu, being the\\n\\nsecond oldest planet according to Vedic Astrology, holds the\\ninformation regarding your future.\\nTherefore, Ketu gives an indication of talents, which you have been\\npolishing up on in previous incarnations and come naturally in the\\npresent life. In summary, Ketu stores your past, and Rahu stores\\nyour future.\\n\\nEffects of Planets in Various Houses\\nHere are some examples of how planets affect natives as they pass\\nthrough the various houses of the Zodiac.\\nWhen Saturn is in the ninth house, he brings about losses in finance.\\nNatives are likely to face obstacles when performing good actions.\\nClose relatives could die, and there could be perpetual sorrow. In the\\ntenth house, Saturn drives the natives to do some sinful action. Also,\\nthere could be a loss of honor for natives. They could suffer from\\ndiseases.\\nSaturn in the eleventh house brings happiness and wealth to the\\nnatives. They are likely to receive great honors too. Saturn in the\\ntwelfth house is likely to drive the natives to pursue worthless and\\nfruitless businesses. Natives are likely to be robbed of their wealth,\\nand spouses and children could fall sick.\\nRahu in the Janma Rashi or the first house brings about death or\\nsickness. In the second, fifth, seventh, and ninth houses, natives\\nlose wealth, money, etc. In the third, sixth, and eleventh houses,\\nRahu brings happiness. In the fourth, he brings sorrow. Rahu in the\\neighth house brings danger to the life of the native. In the tenth\\nhouse, Rahu brings about gain for the natives. In the twelfth house,\\nRahu brings about expenditure.\\nSun and Mars affect the natives only during the first 10 degrees of a\\nhouse, whereas Venus and Jupiter affect when they are in the center\\nof the house, and the powers of Saturn and Moon are effective when\\nthey are in the last part—last 10 degrees of the Zodiac—through\\nwhich they are passing. The effect of Rahu and Mercury are felt right\\nacross the 30 degrees of any given Zodiac.\\n\\nSECTION THREE: Lunar Mansions in Predictive\\nAstrology\\n\\nChapter 6: Timing of Events: Udu-Dashas\\nPredictive Astrology or Phalita Jyotishya—which translates to “that\\nwhich will fructify”—deals with karma, actions, and behaviors that\\ndefine one’s destiny. This sub-branch of astrology also deals with\\nhow you can reverse earlier mistakes and wrongdoings through\\npenance, worship, charity, etc.\\nYour horoscope is like a snapshot of the heavens, as seen from your\\nplace and time of birth. However, the planets are not fixed or frozen.\\nThey are continuously moving. Hindu Astrology, therefore, has two\\ntypes of movements of Grahas or planets. One type is called transits\\nor direct movement of planets in its ecliptic. Another type of\\nmovement is referred to as progressed or projected movement,\\nwhich, in Vedic Astrology, is termed as Dashas.\\nTiming of Events is a unique feature of Vedic Astrology. Vimshottari\\nDasha is an essential tool and technique used in Jyotishya to time\\nevents. This highly popular system has been in use for centuries and\\nis employed both by amateurs, in its basic forms, and professional\\nastrologers, in its advanced and basic forms.\\nVimshottari Dasha is based on the Moon or Chandra’s position on a\\nNakshatra, and therefore, is a Nakshatra Dasha. The first Nakshatra\\n—as you already know—is Ashwini, which is ruled by Ketu. The\\nsecond Nakshatra is Bharani, ruled by Venus or Shukra. This list\\ncontinues until the 27th Nakshatra, Revati, ruled by Mercury or\\nBhuddh. Another popular Dasha is called Kalachakra, and it\\nincorporates both Rashis and Nakshatras.\\n\\nUnderstanding Udu Dasha\\nUdu translates to “flying,” a term also used for Nakshatras. Ideally, all\\nNakshatra Dashas are Udu Dasha. However, in practice, Vimshottari\\nDasha is considered to the “The Udu Dasha.” Astrologers have used\\nthis Dasha as the primary staple for centuries. However, in recent\\ntimes, astrologers like B V Raman, Sri Sanjay Rath, and Sri K. N.\\nRao have studied and produced a large body of work dealing with\\nmultiple other Dashas.\\nThe primary and most basic premise behind the concept of Dashas\\nis this: Life is sectioned into different segments or periods\\nrepresented by planets (Nakshatra Dasha) or signs (Rashi Dasha) in\\nthe horoscopes. The orientation point for Nakshatra Dasha is the\\nnatal moon. Now, visualize the moon’s progress from the moment of\\na native’s birth through the rest of the Zodiac at a slower speed than\\nits direct movement speed, which is about two and a half days per\\nsign.\\nAs the Moon or Chandra passes through the different Nakshatras,\\nthe planet lordship also changes. The planetary lord or ruler is\\nconsidered to be the main planet indicator during the period Chandra\\npasses through that Nakshatra. Some Dashas, including the most\\npopularly used, namely Vimshottari Dashas, have a very long total\\nduration. For example, in the Vimshottari Dasha, the natal moon\\ntakes 120 years to transit through the entire Zodiac, and therefore,\\nmost individuals do not complete the entire cycle in their lifetime.\\n\\nVimshottari Dasha System and Nakshatras\\nAccording to the Vimshottari Dasha system, each of the nine planets\\nin Vedic Astrology rule over varying periods, the total of which is 120\\nyears.\\n•   Ketu rulers for seven years\\n•   Venus rules for twenty years\\n•   The Sun rules for six years\\n•   The Moon rules for ten years\\n•   Mars rules for seven years\\n•   Rahu rules for eighteen years\\n•   Jupiter rules for sixteen years\\n•   Saturn rules for nineteen years\\n•   Mercury rules for seventeen years\\nAlthough there is no rationale behind the formation of the Vimshottari\\nDasha System and the ruling periods, some experts have grouped\\nthe periods into two categories by an imaginary line between the\\nMoon and the orienting (or Udu) point in the Vimshottari scheme and\\nhave come up with the following:\\n•   The periods of Saturn, Jupiter, Rahu, and Mars total 60 years\\n– this is one category.\\n•   The periods of the Moon, the Sun, Venus, Ketu, and Mercury\\ntotal 60 years – this is the second category.\\nTherefore, the outer planets are placed in the first group while the\\ntwo luminaries, namely the Sun and Moon, along with the inner\\nplanets, are placed in the second group. In the Udu Dasha system,\\nthe natal moon’s sidereal constellation position is taken as the point\\nat which the native enters the 120-year cycle. In the 360-degree\\necliptic, there are 27 constellations measuring 13 degrees, 20\\nminutes each. It starts at Aries (0-degrees), which is ruled by Ketu.\\nKetu is followed by Venus, Surya (Sun), Chandra (Moon), Mangala\\n(Mars), Rahu, Jupiter (Guru), Shani (Saturn), and Mercury (Bhuddh)\\nin the same order. This order repeats until all the 27 asterisms are\\ncovered. Each Vimshottari Dasha period (called mahadasha) is\\nfurther subdivided into nine sub-periods called antardashas or\\nbhuktis.\\n\\nThe first bhukti or antardasha is ruled by the lord of the mahadasha\\nand is followed by the bhuktis of the remaining eight in the same\\norder. For example, in the Sun’s Mahadasha, the first antardasha will\\nbe ruled by Sun himself, followed by the Moon, Mars, Rahu, Jupiter,\\nSaturn, Mercury, Venus, and Ketu.\\nEach of the antardashas can be further divided into antaras,\\npratyantaras, sukshmas, and more. However, going into these finer\\ndivisions’ practical usefulness is far less than the cumbersomeness\\nand uncertainty behind the accuracy of such data. Therefore, most\\nastrologers do not go deeper than the antardasha period.\\nThe Vimshottari Dasha System follows the power of the Lords who\\nrule over the Nakshatras. Here is a list of the 27 Nakshatras and the\\nplanet lords that rule them for better understanding. This list is given\\nplanet-wise:\\n1. Ketu rules over Ashwini, Magha, and the Moola (the first,\\ntenth, and nineteenth Nakshatras)\\n2. Venus or Shukra rules over Bharani, Purva Phalguni, and\\nPurvashadam (the second, eleventh, and twentieth Nakshatras)\\n3. Sun or Surya rules over Krittika, Uttara Phalguni, and\\nUttarashada (the third, twelfth, and 21st Nakshatras)\\n4. Moon or Chandra rules over Rohini, Hasta, and Shravana\\n(the fourth, thirteenth, and 22nd Nakshatras)\\n5. Mars or Mangala is the lord of Mrigashirsa, Chitra, and\\nDhanista (the fifth, fourteenth, and 23rd Nakshatras)\\n6. Rahu is the lord of Ardra, Swati, and Shatabhishta (the sixth,\\nfifteenth, and 24th Nakshatras)\\n7. Jupiter or Guru is the lord of Punarvasu, Vishakha, and\\nPurva \\nBhadrapada \\n(the \\nseventh, \\nsixteenth, \\nand \\n25th\\nNakshatras)\\n8. Saturn of Shani is the lord of Pushya, Anuradha, and Uttara\\nBhadrapada (the eighth, seventeenth, and 26th Nakshatras)\\n9. Mercury or Bhuddh is the lord of Ashlesha, Jyestha, and\\nRevati (the ninth, eighteenth, and 27th Nakshatras)\\nTherefore, Ketu, Venus, the Sun, the Moon, Mars, Rahu, Jupiter,\\nSaturn, and Mercury—in that order—rule over three Nakshatras\\neach. The three Nakshatras in one set, ruled by one planet lord, form\\n\\nthe Janma, Anujanma, and Trijanma Nakshatras for each other.\\nFurther, every planet has a sign of exaltation Zodiac sign, which is as\\nfollows:\\n•   The Sun’s exaltation sign is Aries or Mesha Rashi\\n•   The Moon’s exaltation sign is Taurus or Vrishabha Rashi\\n•   Rahu’s exaltation sign is Gemini or Mithuna Rashi\\n•   Jupiter’s exaltation sign is Cancer or Karkata Rashi\\n•   Mercury’s exaltation sign is Virgo or Kanya Rashi\\n•   Saturn’s exaltation sign is Libra or Tula Rashi\\n•   Ketu’s exaltation sign is Sagittarius or Dhanush Rashi\\n•   Mars’s exaltation sign is Capricorn or Makar Rashi\\n•   Shukra’s exaltation sign is Pisces or Kumbha Rashi\\n\\nNakshatras and Planet Transits\\nThe Navatara and Tara Bala system is a Nakshatra predictive\\nsystem used to understand the planets’ transits through the various\\nRashis. This system tracks the transits of important and key\\nNakshatras from the Lagna or the birth Nakshatra. For example, if\\nyour birth Nakshatra is Jyeshtha, this becomes your Janma\\nNakshatra, and the counting for the Navatara and Tara Bala system\\nstarts from Jyeshtha. Then, the first nine Nakshatras for you would\\nbe as follows:\\n1. Jyeshtha\\n2. Moola\\n3. Purvashada\\n4. Uttarashada\\n5. Shravana\\n6. Dhanishta\\n7. Shatabisha\\n8. Purva Bhadrapada\\n9. Uttara Bhadrapada\\nThese first nine Nakshatra counted from your Janma Nakshatra hold\\nfar more potency to deliver effects than the second and third tier of\\nnine Nakshatras. This concept, referred to as Udu-Dashas, has a\\ndeep connection to Dasas and planet transits.\\nFurther, according to Andrew Foss, a Vedic Astrologer of high repute\\nand author of the best-selling book Yoga of the Planets, these nine\\nimportant aspects of your life are connected to planetary rulers and\\nthe sequence of the Dasha system. Read on to find out how the\\nDashas affect these nine important aspects of your life.\\nJanma or Your Birth – This crucial aspect of your life is related to\\nthe first house in the Udu-Dasha system. Mercury and Ketu influence\\nthis aspect. Your Janma is connected to your birth Nakshatra which,\\naccording to the Udu-Dasha system, becomes the first Nakshatra for\\nyou, and the tenth and the nineteenth asterisms, which are your\\nAnujamna and Trijanma Nakshatras.\\nYour birth star governs everything in your life. Furthermore, the moon\\nis connected to your mind, and the star under the moon’s influence\\n\\nbecomes the seat of your soul. The birth star and your first house\\nrepresent a focused form of your ability to synthesize all your life\\nexperiences using your intelligence.\\nThe ruler of this aspect, Mercury, also governs early childhood, and\\nthis planet’s influence and position determine the status of your birth,\\nthe development of your thought process, and education during that\\ntime of your life.\\nAndrew Foss says this about the Janma Nakshatra: “It is the fruit\\nempowered to fulfill our desires depending on what we deserve.”\\nNow, when Saturn transits through your birth star, it shakes up\\ncertain things in your life because Saturn is a natural enemy of\\nMercury and Ketu. Therefore, your health could be challenged,\\nwhich can be seen as a reminder to seek liberation (or moksha) in\\nthis lifetime.\\nThe birth star for most astrologers is a point of conflict. Some believe\\nthat the first house is beneficial, and some think it is malefic.\\nTherefore, it makes sense to accept a balanced approach to this\\ncrucial house. The birth star mostly supports the native, yet the\\nbeneficial effects could fall prey to hidden challenges or connection\\nto the eighth house.\\nJanma Nakshatras, which are one, ten, and nineteen, are connected\\nto Mercury. If your birth Nakshatra is also ruled by Mercury, all the\\nother asterisms owned by Mercury will have a Janma relationship in\\nyour horoscope.\\nSampat – Sampat is related to gains. The status of your second and\\neleventh house—counted from Lagna—determines this factor in your\\nlife and is ruled by Venus. The Sampat houses are the second,\\neleventh, and twentieth Nakshatras from your Janma Nakshatra and\\nare ruled by Venus. Number 2 in Vedic Astrology is always related to\\nthe accumulation of wealth, gains, and profits.\\nTherefore, in your Rashi Chart or birth chart, benefic planets placed\\nhere during their Dasas bring gains for you, and malefic planets\\ncould bring losses and a sense of deprivation. Transits through the\\nsecond star are gainful for the native. Therefore, Jupiter transiting\\nthrough the second star can be particularly profitable for the naïve as\\n\\nthis planet is connected to good fortune, acquisitions, blessings, and\\nprosperity.\\nTo illustrate with an example, if your birth star is Swait, Jupiter will\\nbring gains and profits when it is transiting through Vishakha.\\nSimilarly, for a native born in Jyestha Nakshatra, Moola would be the\\nsecond Nakshatra, which means all Ketu stars will bring good\\nfortune for this native whenever benefic planets transit through them.\\nVipat – Another critical life element, Vipat, is all about dangers to\\nyour wealth and money. This aspect is connected to the eighth and\\ntwelfth houses, counted from your Lagna, and is ruled by Sun, the\\nplanet connected to wealth. Vipat Nakshatra is the third asterism\\nfrom your natal moon. The third Nakshatra has the power to destroy\\nadharma and people who do not follow dharma.\\nAs it is ruled by the Sun, the planet related to wealth, the third\\nNakshatra position is important for obtaining or losing wealth. You\\nalready know that Sun and Saturn are bitter enemies. Therefore, it is\\neasy to understand that you are likely to face significant financial\\nproblems when Saturn transits through the third house.\\nFor example, if your Janma Nakshatra is Jyeshta, the third\\nNakshatra would be Purvashada. When Saturn transits through this\\nNakshatra, its energy to create financial problems for the concerned\\nnative will be triggered. Vimpat positions can lead to the native\\nmaking bad decisions and putting forth multiple challenges for them\\nduring major transits like Saturn, Rahu, or Ketu. It is also connected\\nto the twelfth house, which is also related to the loss of wealth. A\\npositive way of looking at such seeming losses is that these difficult\\ntimes drive one to look spiritually upwards and find their path to\\nliberation.\\nKshema – Kshema relates to happiness and security in your life, is\\nconnected to the fourth Nakshatra, and is ruled by Moon. The fourth,\\nthirteenth, and 22nd Nakshatras from your birth star are related to\\nKshema, which is associated with a disease-free life of comfort and\\nease. The fourth Nakshatra is connected with the feelings of security\\nthat the native gets.\\nTherefore, when benefic planets like Jupiter and Venus transit\\nthrough the fourth, thirteenth, and 22nd Nakshatras, the native may\\n\\nhave a substantial improvement in their state of happiness. On the\\nother hand, malefic planets like Ketu could result in unhappy\\ndisruptions to the native’s life.\\nPrayatak – Prayatak is related to obstacles and enemies, is ruled by\\nMars, and is managed by the fifth, fourteenth, and 23rd Nakshatras\\nfrom your Janma Nakshatra. This aspect of your life is connected to\\nthe third and sixth houses. It is related to enemies and rivals who\\ncan instill fear of destruction in the native.\\nMars, the ruler of this position and aspect, is the lord who prevents\\nyou from violating your dharma. After all, no one really wants to do\\nwrongful deeds to face the wrath of a weapon-wielding warrior like\\nMars. So, fear helps keep your adharma actions in check.\\nWith Mars ruling this life aspect, there is bound to be frustrations and\\nindecisions when Saturn, the enemy of Mars, transits through this\\nNakshatra. The primary objective of the fifth Nakshatra is to fight and\\ncompete to do your dharma. Therefore, if your birth Nakshatra is\\nVishakha when Saturn transits through Purvashada, you are likely to\\nface the malefic effects of Saturn even if your Sade Sati is three\\nsigns away.\\nSadhana – Sadhana is the fulfillment, accomplishments, and\\nattainment of desires and is ruled by Rahu. The life element is\\nconnected to the eleventh house. Sadhana is managed by the sixth,\\nfifteenth, and 24th Nakshatras from your birth asterism. Benefic\\nplanets transiting through the sixth Nakshatra will bring fruits, while\\nmalefic planets will bring forth struggle and prevent opportunities\\nfrom being available.\\nInterestingly, because Rahu is connected to this Nakshatra, desires\\nand accomplishments may be fulfilled through unethical and devious\\nmeans. For example, if your birth star is Chitra, when Saturn transits\\nthrough Purvashada—the sixth Nakshatra from your Janma\\nNakshatra—this period could get support through the transits, and\\nyour desires could lead to fruition, provided it all fits in with the\\ncontext of your Dasha period.\\nNaidhana or Vadha – This interesting and important part of your life\\ndeals with changes driven by the death or destruction of old things\\nand elements. It is ruled by Jupiter and is connected to the eighth\\n\\nhouse. It is represented by the seventh, sixteenth, and 23rd\\nNakshatras from your birth star.\\nWhen malefic planets like Rahu, Ketu, or Saturn transit through the\\nseventh, sixteenth, and 23rd Nakshatras, the native is likely to face\\nchallenges. These life experiences are also connected to the eighth\\nhouse from the Lagna, where malefic planets can bring about acute\\nillnesses, sudden accidents, or divorces without warning. The eighth\\nhouse experiences are excellent lessons for one to transcend\\nbeyond the mundane materialism and search for the true meaning\\nand purpose of life.\\nMitra – Life without partners and friends is not worth living. Your\\nhoroscope helps you determine how your friends and partners will\\nhelp or harm you by studying the “mitra” aspect of your life, which\\nSaturn rules and is related to the seventh house and the eighth,\\nseventeenth, and 26th Nakshatras from your birth star.\\nSaturn appears to be an unusual ruler in this place, considering this\\naspect deals with friends and progress. Andrew Foss explains that\\nthe fulfillment of desire after waiting so long—in that you have\\nforgotten you had the desire at all—is a reflection of Saturn’s power\\nto do good by making you work hard, responsibly, and with patience.\\nHis seemingly malign attitude shows that your laziness and\\nirresponsible behavior will not bring your desires to fruition.\\nParam Mitra – This aspect deals with great friends and spiritual\\nfulfillment. Ruled by Ketu, it is related to the ninth and twelfth houses\\nfrom your Lagna and the ninth, eighteenth, and 27th Nakshatras\\nfrom your Janma Nakshatra. In the ninth Nakshatra and ninth house,\\nall planets support the native and bring good fortune.\\nThe ninth Nakshatra is connected to Ketu, a planet reflecting the\\ntime and place where your karma’s and desires\\' ultimate liberation\\nand fruition are completed. The ninth house is the peak of your\\naccomplishments. Benefic planets transiting through the ninth\\nNakshatra are bound to hold great promise for natives.\\nImportantly, Dasha’s effects should be read or studied by\\nthemselves. You must refer to the birth chart and the transits. The\\nstars of the dashas and the asterisms’ and planet lords’ dispositions\\nrepresent sensitive areas in the concerned native’s life. Therefore, all\\n\\naspects of astrology have to be taken into account to arrive at\\naccurate and sensible predictions.\\n\\nChapter \\n7: \\nNakshatras \\nand \\nRelationship\\nCompatibility\\nRelationship and marriage compatibility is not just an interesting\\ntopic but an essential element in Predictive Vedic Astrology. In Indian\\nculture, where arranged marriages are the norm, comparing\\nhoroscopes to see if the potential couple are suitable for each other\\nis the starting point of any marriage plans. Moreover, multiple cases\\nhave proved the efficacy of horoscope comparisons before arranging\\nmarriages. The interest and the intrigue behind the concept are, of\\ncourse, unmistakable. Therefore, this chapter is part of this book on\\nNakshatras.\\nJust to give you an overview at this juncture, there are 27\\nNakshatras in the Zodiac, each having four padas or quarters. The\\nasterisms are connected to different Rashis or Zodiac Signs, as well\\nas the nine planets. The star in which you were born is referred to as\\nthe birth star. If you start counting from here, your birth star is #1.\\nThe tenth star from here counted in Nakshatras’ accepted order—\\nfrom Ashwini to Revati—will be your Anujanma Nakshatra, and the\\nnineteenth asterism will be your Trijanma Nakshatra. These three\\nasterisms are crucial components that are considered during the\\nmatchmaking of a bride and groom.\\nThe nine asterisms starting from your birth star represent nine facets\\nof human life, including Janma, Sampat, Vipat, Kshema, Pratyaka,\\nSadhana, Vata, Mitra, and Parama Mitra. Furthermore, the first nine\\nnakshatras are referred to as the first pariraya, the second nine are\\ncalled the second pariraya, and the third set of nine asterisms is\\ncalled the third pariraya. This point plays an important during\\nhoroscope matching.\\nTwo main types of relationships can be formed while matching\\nhoroscopes, namely Uttama (Best Relationships) and Madhyama\\n(Moderate Relationships). The nakshatras of the boy and the girl are\\ntaken into consideration. The astrologer starts the count from the\\ngirl’s Janma Nakshatra and counts until the boy’s Janma Nakshatra.\\nIf this count is four, six, or nine, which stands for Sadhana, Kshema,\\nand Parama Mitra, the relationship is considered uttama or the best,\\n\\nand the marriage has a high chance of success. According to this\\ncounting structure, uttama relationships can be formed between the\\nsixth, fifteenth, and 24th Nakshatras, the second, eleventh, and\\ntwentieth Nakshatras, and the ninth, eighteenth, and 27th\\nNakshatras.\\nIf the count from the girl’s to the boy’s birth star is three, five, or\\nseven, the relationship is believed to be bad, and the marriage\\nproposal is rarely taken forward. More detailed layers need to be\\nconsidered depending on which pariraya the Nakshatras of the girl\\nand boy fall. In some cases, certain padas of the Nakshatras are\\nconsidered good, while other padas are rejected.\\nThe second type of relationship, called Madhyama or average, is\\nformed when the boy’s and girl’s birth stars have a Janma,\\nAnujanma, and Trijanma relationship with each other. Therefore,\\nMadhyama relationships can be formed with the first, tenth, and\\nnineteenth Nakshatras, the second, eleventh, and twentieth\\nNakshatras, and the eighth, seventeenth, and 26th Nakshatras.\\nAn important rule is associated with the number 27, considering\\nthere are 27 Nakshatras in the Zodiac. If the count from the girl’s\\nJanma Nakshatra to the boy’s is 27 and if Chandra is in the same\\nsign for both, the marriage is likely to meet with success. However, if\\nthe Moon in the boy’s Rashi Chart is in the twelfth house of the girl’s\\nMoon, the relationship will not be good.\\nIf the girl and boy share the same Nakshatra, the following rules\\nhold:\\n•   Uttama Relationships – If the stars of both the girl and the\\nboy are Rohini, Ardra, Magha, Hasta, Vishakha, Shravana,\\nUttara Bhadrapada, or Revati, the relationship will be the best\\nor Uttama.\\n•   Madhyama Relationships – If the stars of both the girl and\\nboy are Ashwini, Krittika, Mrigashirsha, Pushya, Purvashada, or\\nUttarashada, the relationship will be moderate or Madhyama.\\n•   Atamam or Bad – If both the girl and boy are of Bharani,\\nAshlesha, Swati, Jyeshta, Moola, Dhanishta, Shatabisha, or\\nPurva Bhadrapada, the relationship is no good.\\n\\nAshtakoot Guna Milan\\nAshtakoot Guna Milan is an astrological system used to match the\\ncompatibility factors between prospective brides and grooms. This\\nmethod uses the Moon Chart, the Moon Sign, or Rashi and the\\nprospective couple’s birth stars to assess the compatibility between\\nthem. There are eight factors called Koots, consisting of 36 Gunas,\\nthat are taken into account while calculating the Guna, namely:\\n1. Varna Koot – This element is related to ego and reflects the\\nindividual’s personality and background.\\n2. Vashya Koot – Vashya Koot is about power and relates to\\nthe power equation and controlling person between the couple.\\n3. Tara Koot – This element reflects the friendship between the\\nNakshatras of the bride and groom. It talks about the proximity\\nbetween the two stars.\\n4. Yoni Koot – This element is all about the sexual attraction\\nbetween the prospective bride and groom.\\n5. Graha-Maitri Koot – This is related to the harmony between\\nthe Rashi charts of the girl and boy.\\n6. Gana Koot – This element is connected to the temperament\\nand behavior of the boy and girl.\\n7. Bhakoot – This element is about love and is connected to\\nthe boy’s and girl’s Rashi Moon positions.\\n8. Nadi Koot – This is connected to the health and genes of\\nthe prospective couple.\\nThe weightage given to each of these factors is the same as the\\nserial number against them, and the maximum score is 36.\\nThe Asktakoot Guna Milan calculates the Guna and arrives at a\\nscore for the match, which can be an indicator of the marriage’s\\nfuture. If the score is less than eighteen, the marriage is not likely to\\nbe successful. A score between eighteen and 24 reflects an average\\nmarriage.\\nA score of about 24 suggests that the marriage has a high potential\\nfor success, with the couple being happy in their relationship. Scores\\nbetween 25-32 are good, while those between 32 and 36 are\\n\\nconsidered exceptional, and the marriage is destined for success.\\nNow, look at the eight Koots in more detail.\\nVarna Koot – The Varna is a determining factor of an individual’s\\nego and personality according to their Zodiac sign. According to\\nVedic Astrology, Zodiac signs are divided into four Varnas, namely\\nBrahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya, and Shudra, in descending order of\\nhierarchy.\\n•   Cancer (Karkata Rashi), Scorpio (Vrischika Rashi), and\\nPisces (Meena Rashi) belong to the Brahmin Varna\\n•   Aries (Mesha Rashi), Leo (Simha Rashi), and Sagittarius\\n(Dhanush Rashi) belong to the Kshatriya Varna\\n•   Taurus (Vrishabha Rashi), Virgo (Kanya Rashi), and\\nCapricorn (Makar Rashi) belong to the Vaishya Varna.\\n•   Gemini (Mithuna Rashi), Aquarius (Kumbh Rashi), and Libra\\n(Tula Rashi) belong to the Shudra Varna\\nMarriages made between a girl and a boy within the same Varna are\\nconsidered to be auspicious. If the groom’s Varna is higher than the\\nbride’s, the match is considered approachable. However, if the\\nbride’s Varna is higher than the boy’s, it signifies an inauspicious\\nmarriage.\\nVashya Koot – This category of Guna compatibility is a reflection of\\nwho will dominate in the marriage. It is not just domination over a\\npartner but the power of holding the reins attractively and sensibly to\\nmake a success of the marriage. Holding 2 points, this category\\ninvolves Zodiac signs and their connection to five types of animals,\\nincluding the following:\\n•   Chatushpada (translates to four-footed) – Aries, Taurus, the\\nfirst half of Capricorn, and Sagittarius’s second half\\n•   Human – Gemini, Virgo, Libra, Aquarius, and the first half of\\nSagittarius\\n•   Jalchar (water animals) – Cancer, Pisces, and the second\\nhalf of Capricorn\\n•   Vanacara (jungle or wild animals) – Leo\\n•   Keet (worms) – Scorpio\\n\\nThere is a scoring system when the Zodiac signs of the bride and\\ngroom are matched. For example, if the bride and groom both have\\nZodiac signs in the Chatuspada category, the score is 2—which is\\nthe maximum allocated for this Koot. There are 25 such\\ncombinations, and each combination is given a score ranging from 0\\nto 2.\\nSimply put, when both belong to the same animal category, the\\nscore is the maximum, namely 2. Score 1 is given for the following\\ncombinations:\\n•   Bride – human, groom – chatuspada\\n•   Bride – jalchar, groom – chatuspada\\n•   Bride – Keet, groom – chatuspada\\n•   Bride – Chatuspada, Groom human\\n•   Bride – Keet, Groom – human\\n•   Bride – Chatuspada, Groom – Jalchar\\n•   Bride – Keet, Groom – Keet\\n•   Bride – Jalchar, Groom – Vanacara\\n•   Bride – Chatuspada, Groom – Keet\\n•   Bride – Human, Groom – Keet\\n•   Bride – Jalchar, Groom – Keet\\nScore 1.5 is given for the following combinations:\\n•   Bride – Jalchar, Groom – Human\\n•   Bride – Human, Groom – Jalchar\\n•   Bride – Chatuspada, Groom – Vanacara\\nScore 0 is given for the following combinations:\\n•   Bride – Vanacara, Groom – Chatuspada\\n•   Bride – Vanacara, Groom – human\\n•   Bride – Vanacara, Groom – jalchar\\n•   Bride – Keet, Groom – Vanacara\\n•   Bride - Vanacara, Groom – Keet\\n•   Bride – human, Groom – Vanacara\\nTara Koot – This category determines the overall destiny and well-\\nbeing of the prospective couple. The 27 Nakshatras are divided into\\nnine groups. Studying the bride’s and groom’s stars within the\\n\\nframework of this division is a good indicator of the marriage’s\\nsuccess. Starting from the bride’s star, count until the boy’s\\nNakshatra is reached. Divide this number by 9; the remainder\\nreflects the overall well-being of the couple. The remainder is\\nmatched against the nine life aspects discussed in the previous\\nchapter. They are:\\n1. Janma - Bad\\n2. Sampath – Good\\n3. Vipat – Bad\\n4. Kshema – Good\\n5. Prayatak – Bad\\n6. Sadhana – Good\\n7. Vadha or Naidhana – Bad\\n8. Mitra – Good\\n9. Parama Mitra – Good\\nFor example, if the count from the girl’s star to the boy’s star is 12,\\ndividing 12 by 9 gets you a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 3. Now,\\n3 represents Vipat, which is bad, and therefore, the Tara Koot\\nindicator is not good for the marriage.\\nYoni Koot – The matching of this prospective couple’s aspect is the\\nmost popular in matching horoscopes for marriages. This Koot\\nstands for the sexual energy and attraction between the girl and boy.\\nNakshatras are given animal symbols that reflect each asterism’s\\nsexual behavior. The sexual compatibility is achieved by comparing\\nthe animals projected by both the girl’s and boy’s birth stars.\\nThe five animals include:\\n1. Swabhava Yoni\\n2. Friend or Mitra Yoni\\n3. Neutral Yoni\\n4. Opposite Yoni\\n5. Enemy Yoni\\nThe sexual compatibility is the best in the Swabhava Yoni pair\\nbecause both the bride and the groom share the same class of Yoni.\\nIt is easy to understand that the least compatible pair is the Enemy\\npair because each of the partners belongs to an entirely different\\n\\nyoni class. Now, look at the classification of Nakshatras based on\\nYoni and use examples to explain the pairs:\\n•   Ashwini and Shatabhisha belong to the Ashwa (horse) class\\nof Yoni\\n•   Bharani and Revati belong to the Gaja (elephant) class of\\nYoni\\n•   Pushya and Kritika belong to the Mesha (sheep) class of Yoni\\n•   Rohini and Mrigashirsha belong to the Sarpa (serpent) class\\nof Yoni\\n•   Moola and Ardra belong to the Shwan (dog) class of Yoni\\n•   Ashlesha and Punarvasu belong to the Marjara (cat) class of\\nYoni\\n•   Magha and Purva Phalguni belong to the Mushaka (rat) class\\nof Yoni\\n•   Uttara Phalguni and Uttara Bhadrapada belong to the Gau\\n(cow) class of Yoni\\n•   Swati and Hasta belong to the Mahisha (buffalo) class of Yoni\\n•   Vishakha and Chitra belong to the Vyaghra (tiger) class of\\nYoni\\n•   Jyeshtha and Anuradha belong to the Mriga (deer) class of\\nYoni\\n•   Purvashada and Shravana belong to the Vanara (monkey)\\nclass of Yoni\\n•   Uttarashada and Abhijeet belong to the Nakul (mongoose)\\nclass of Yoni\\n•   Purva Bhadrapada and Dhanishta belong to the Singha (lion)\\nclass of Yoni\\nNatives belonging to the same class of Yoni are sexually more\\ncompatible than natives belonging to different classes. For example,\\nif the bride and groom are of Moola and Ashlesha Nakshatra,\\nrespectively, their Yoni classes would be dog and cat, which are\\nnatural enemies. Therefore, their sexual compatibility from their\\nhoroscopes’ point of view will not be good at all.\\nGraha-Maitri Koot – This element in the Ashtakoot Guna Milan\\nsystem is used to determine the mutual love and respect and\\n\\nmentality of a prospective couple. This element is also a measure of\\nthe partners’ willingness to work together to make the marriage\\nsuccessful. This element’s score will help you determine whether\\nyou and your prospective spouse will agree with each other more or\\ndisagree.\\nThis aspect is studied in detail by reading into the planet lords of the\\nprospective bride’s and groom’s Zodiac signs. If the Rashis of the\\nbride and groom are ruled by friendly planets and belong to the\\nsame Moon sign, the pair is expected to be highly compassionate\\nand understanding of each other.\\nContrarily, if enemy planets rule the Zodiac signs of the bride and the\\ngroom, this element’s score will be low, and the marriage would not\\nbe an approachable one. The maximum points for this element are\\n6.\\nGana Koot – This element determines the basic characteristic of a\\nperson. Nakshatras are divided into three categories, namely Devta,\\nManushya, and Rakshasa Gana. These categories represent three\\ndifferent natures or behavioral attitudes of the native. For example, a\\nperson from the Devta Gana would be patient and gentle in their\\nbehavior. An individual from the Rakshasa Gana would be\\ninconsiderate, rude, aggressive, but straightforward. A person from\\nthe Manushya Gana would be somewhere between these two. They\\nwould be gentle but ready to become aggressive if the situation\\ndemanded it. Here are the Nakshatras and their respective Ganas:\\n•   Devta Gana – Ashwini, Mrigashirsha, Punarvasu, Pushya,\\nHasta, Swati, Anuradha, Shravana, and Revati\\n•   Manushya Gana – Bharani, Rohini, Ardra, Purva Phalguni,\\nUttara Phalguni, Purvashada, Uttarashada, Purva Bhadrapada,\\nand Uttara Bhadrapada\\n•   Rakshasa Gana – Krittika, Ashlesha, Magha, Chitra,\\nVishakha, Jyeshtha, Moola, Dhanishta, and Satabhisha\\nBhakoot Koot – Also referred to as Rashi Koot, this element of the\\nAshtakoot Guna Milan system is allocated 7 points. The moon signs,\\nand the placement of Chandra in the Rashi Charts of the prospective\\ncouple, are taken into consideration for this Koot. These two aspects\\nare analyzed and evaluated for their strengths and weaknesses.\\n\\nIf the bride and groom’s birth sign is 6-8, Shadashtak Yoga is\\nconsidered to be formed. In this Yoga, if the planet lords of the two\\nMoon signs are natural enemies, the marital life is likely to be full of\\nproblems and sufferings. Financial problems, accidents, and\\nproblems from direct and indirect enemies are likely to bring\\nsuffering to the married couple.\\nDwidwadash dosha is when a combination of 2-12 is obtained when\\ncomparing the bride’s and groom’s birth signs. If the combination is\\n5-9, Navapancham Dosha is formed. The Navapancham Dosha\\nmakes the groom have a sense of detachment from the real world.\\nContrarily, if the bride’s moon sign is 9 when counted from the\\ngroom’s moon sign, the bride might tend to abandon the world.\\nHowever, if the planets of both moon signs are friendly, this situation\\ncould settle down.\\nFull points, 7, is given if the bride’s and groom’s Moon signs are the\\nsame or if the moon of both is on the 1/7, 3/11, and 4/10 axes. This\\nGuna gets 0 points if the moon is on the 2/12, 5/9, and 6/8 axis.\\nNadi Koot – The 27 Nakshatras are categorized into three types,\\nnamely Aadi, Madhya, and Antya Nadi. These are collectively called\\nNadi Milan or Nadi Dosha. With 8 points, this Koot is an important\\nelement to consider for matching the horoscopes of the bride and\\ngroom.\\nNadi should be different for the bride and groom for the horoscopes\\nto get a go-ahead for marriage. If they are the same, the marriage\\nwill not be a good one because the children of this marriage could\\nsuffer from health problems. While the same Nadi couples should\\nnot be considered for marriage, if the Nakshatras of the bride and\\ngroom are different, the same Nadi can be considered. Matching\\nNadi Koot is a complex and layered process.\\nAccording to Vedic Astrology, a marriage between a bride and\\ngroom, both belonging to Devta Gana Nakshatras, would be highly\\nauspicious. A marriage between a groom from the Rakshasa Gana\\nand a bride from the Devta Gana would be very inauspicious and\\nunstable. Ideally, people from the same Gana should be chosen as\\npartners.\\n\\nLastly, while the Ashtakoot Guna Milan score gives a reasonable,\\nclear picture of marriage prospects, it is not sufficient by itself. Other\\nastrological factors should also be considered before arriving at a\\nfinal decision. Expert astrologers believe that the scores can be\\ntaken as a good indicator but should never be taken in isolation. The\\nother factors to be considered along with the Ashtakoot Guna Milan\\nscores include:\\n•   The Lagna of the bride and groom\\n•   The strength of the ascendant and that of its ruler\\n•   The strength of the seventh house and its ruler\\n•   The strength and nature of Jupiter and Venus\\n•   The natural friendship/relationship between the rulers of the\\nLagna and the seventh house\\n•   All the Nakshatra positions that deal with mental, physical,\\nand financial compatibility of the bride and groom\\nVenus specifically requires special attention because this planet’s\\nstrength and weakness play an important role in a marriage’s\\nsuccess or failure. Inauspicious placement of Venus in the boy’s\\nhoroscope can cause infertility. In a girl’s horoscope, Jupiter plays a\\ncrucial because it reflects the house of the husband. Its strength and\\nweakness can be a good indicator of the future of marriage.\\nYou can also see how Nakshatras and other aspects of Vedic\\nAstrology can help you determine a good partner for yourself. The\\nnext chapter deals with career planning.\\n\\nChapter 8: Nakshatras and Career Planning\\nCareer Planning is another important topic in Predictive Vedic\\nAstrology.

Having a strong basic idea\\nwill help you understand your life’s career path even as you seek a\\nprofessional’s guidance.\\n\\nChapter 9: The Muhurta: Electional Astrology\\nMuhurta or Electional Astrology—also known as event astrology—is\\nbased on the concept of Nakshatras and involves determining what\\nthe best time for an event is based on the astrological\\nauspiciousness of that time. It plays an important part in all Indian\\nhouseholds because the start of any crucial event sets the pace for\\nthe event’s success or failure. Again, Nakshatras and its various\\nconnected aspects, including directions, natures, and others, fix\\nauspicious times for events—a topic referred to as Electional\\nAstrology.\\n\\nUnderstanding the Concept of Muhurta\\nMuhurta has multiple connotations and definitions. Interestingly,\\nAbhijeet Nakshatra—the 28th one that is not considered for other\\naspects of predictive astrology—plays an important role in Muhurtha.\\nRead on to learn more.\\nMuhurta is a measure of time used in Hindu calendars. The duration\\nof a muhurta is 48 minutes counted from the time of sunrise. It is\\nimportant to note here that according to the Hindu calendar known\\nas Panchanga System, a day of 24 hours is measured from sunrise\\nto sunrise and not from midnight.\\nThe smallest time unit known to ancient India’s seers is called a\\n“Nimisha,” which is considered the smallest unit of time conceivable\\nby human beings. “Nimisha” is defined as “the blink of an eye.” This\\nis a linear concept and a fixed measure. The bigger measurements\\nof time are:\\n•   Fifteen nimisha equals one kashta\\n•   Fifteen kashta equals one laghu\\n•   Fifteen laghu equals one ghatika (another name for ghatika is\\n“danda”)\\n•   Two ghatika (or 30 laghu) equals one muhurta\\n•   30 muhurta equals one divai-ratri (24 hours)\\nAstrologically, one muhurta is not taken exactly as 48 minutes every\\nday. This value varies depending on the local moon, sunrise, and\\nsunset. It is a non-linear, cyclical concept, and therefore, is not fixed.\\nOne sidereal day and night—referred to as “nakshatra ahoratra”—\\nhas 30 muhurtas. Each sidereal day and night is divided into four\\ntime zones—called Praharas, each of seven and one-third muhurtas\\n—as follows:\\n•   The time between sunrise and noon is the first Prahara\\n•   The time between noon and sunset is the second Prahara\\n•   The time between sunset and midnight is the third Prahara\\n•   The time between midnight and the next sunrise is the fourth\\nPrahara\\nThe four points in time, namely sunrise, noon, sunset, and midnight\\nare called Gayatri pada. Therefore, four Praharas make 24 hours.\\n\\nThe Abhijeet Muhurta, which is the last half Muhurta in the first\\nPrahara and the first half Muhurta in the second Prahara, is\\nconsidered very auspicious as it is mapped to the Abhijeet\\nNakshatra ruled by Lord Hari.\\nThe seven Nakshatras before Abhijeet, namely Swati, Vishakha,\\nAnuradha, Jyeshtha, Magha, Purva Phalguni, and Uttara Phalguni,\\nconstitute the remaining seven Muhurtas in the first Prahara. The\\nbalance of twenty Nakshatras then fits into the twenty Muhurtas of\\nthe remaining three Praharas after the Abhijeet Muhurta. Thus, all\\nthe 28 Nakshatra fit into the 28 Muhurtas of each day. The remaining\\ntwo Muhurtas of the day—totaling 96 minutes before sunrise—are\\nattributed to the God of Creation, Brahma, and, therefore, is loosely\\nreferred to as Brahma Muhurta.\\nHowever, the last two Muhurtas have different energies and are\\nbetter associated with different deities. The 29th—the second last\\none—is attributed to Brahma, and the last one belongs to Surya, or\\nSavitur, the Sun God’s creative form. Lord Brahma is the ruling deity\\nof Saturn and is related to the rebirth of the soul, which is why the\\n29th Brahma Muhurta is great to meditate on your Creator.\\nThe last Muhurta is excellent for seeking the blessings of Savitur to\\ndirect your intelligence to the correct path. Each of the other\\nMuhurtas of the day has its own significance.\\n\\nSelection of the Muhurta\\nThe following factors are taken into consideration during Muhurta\\nselection, which consists of the day and time to undertake events:\\n•   The tithi (or the Lunar Day)\\n•   Nakshatra (the asterism in which Chandra is placed on that\\nday)\\n•   The Yoga Karana (or the auspiciousness of the chosen time)\\n•   Vara (the weekday)\\nIn addition to the above, certain times during the day are considered\\ngood/bad, and certain combinations of Nakshatras and weekdays\\nare considered good/bad, etc. These considerations also need to be\\ntaken into account before selecting the Muhurta.\\n\\nThe Thithi\\nThere are 30 thithis in a lunar month divided into two fortnights, each\\nstarting from the new moon day and the full moon day. In addition to\\nbeing the lunar date, a thithi is a measure of the Sun and Moon’s\\nseparation. Each Thithi has its own planetary lord, and people born\\nin different thithis have varying characteristics. For example, a\\nperson born on the full moon day (Poornima) has stronger\\ncharacteristic traits than one born on a new moon day (amavasya).\\nThe thithis are divided into five types:\\n1. Ananda (Joyous) Thithis – Prathipada (the first day of the\\nfortnight), Shasti (the sixth day), and Ekadashi (the eleventh\\nday) form the full moon or amavasya day. These days bestow\\njoy and happiness.\\n2. Mangala Thithis – Also known as Bhadra, Arogya, or\\nhealthy thithis, these include Dwitiya (the second day), Saptami\\n(the seventh day), and Dwadashi (the twelfth day). These days\\nare good for starting new work.\\n3. Jaya Thithis – Jaya means victory, and the days include\\nTritiya (the third day of a fortnight) that falls on a Tuesday,\\nAshtami (the eighth day), and Trayodashi (the thirteenth day).\\nThese days are good for winning over rivals and enemies.\\n4. Rikkta Thithis – Also known as Nashta or Loss thithis, these\\nlunar days include Chaturthi (the fourth day) falling on a\\nSaturday, Navami (the ninth day), and Chaturdashi (the\\nfourteenth day). These days are not good to undertake any\\nimportant work or event –they should be completely avoided.\\n5. Poorna Thithis – Also known as Sampoorna days, these\\nthithis include Panchami (the fifth day falling on a Thursday),\\nDashami (the tenth day), and Amavasya or Poornima (the\\nfifteenth day of the fortnight. These are good for doing all\\nactivities.\\nAdditionally, times such as Rahukalam, Gulika Kalam, and\\nYamagandam that happen every day should be avoided while fixing\\nthe Muhurta for auspicious events. The days of the week (Vara) have\\ntheir important elements to consider. Now, look at them in more\\ndetail.\\n\\nVara or Weekday\\nSunday – Sunday is known as Adivaram and Bhanuvaram as it is\\nrelated to the Sun God, Surya, who is also known as Aditya.\\nAdivaram is a day of life and a day filled with pure consciousness. It\\nis a day to enjoy life, the power of the sun, and focus on the inner\\nself. Sunday is a good day for work related to gold, trees, copper,\\nnature, fire, silk, and coronation. On this day, controlling your temper\\nand ego yields good karma, and it is also important not to be rude or\\nlazy.\\nMonday – Known as Somavaram, this day is dedicated to the Moon\\nor Chandra. It is a day of original thinking, creativity, and intuition. It’s\\ngood for purchasing new items, including jewelry, clothes, and\\nothers. It’s also a good day to conduct marriages, make intuitive\\ndecisions, and make changes with elements related to your mother,\\nmilk, and water. It’s important not to be rigid and tough on Mondays.\\nMoreover, it’s not good for hair cutting, a manicure, and other barber-\\nor parlor-related activities.\\nTuesday – Tuesday or Mangalvaram is dedicated to Mars or\\nMangala. It is a day for material things and good for work related to\\nmetals, minerals, fire, medicine, sporting activities, and electricity. It’s\\nnot a good day to start new things. It’s better to avoid traveling on\\nTuesdays. You must take care and beware of quarrels, injuries,\\naccidents, and falls on Tuesdays.\\nWednesday – Known as Bhuddhavaram, it is a day dedicated to\\nMercury or Bhuddh. It’s a day of knowledge, wisdom, and happiness.\\nIt’s a good day for all kinds of refined work, including sales,\\nbusiness, shopping, starting new projects, communicating, gaining\\nknowledge, taking medicines, marriages, and more. It’s best if you\\navoid lying and being cruel and violent on Wednesdays.\\nThursday – Called Guruvaram, according to the Vedic Calendar,\\nThursday is dedicated to Jupiter or Guru. It is a day of knowledge,\\nwisdom, devotion, money, and children. It’s a highly favorable day for\\nall kinds of activities such as marriages, charitable work, gifts,\\nshopping for important things, trading, planning finances, and\\nstarting new things in your life. You must not get angry, be greedy,\\nlazy, or violent on Thursdays.\\n\\nFriday – Friday or Shukravaram is dedicated to Venus or Shukra. It\\nis a day of pleasures, love, harmony, fine arts, happiness, and good\\nfortune. It’s good for purchasing clothes, accessories, including\\njewelry, marriages, inviting and visiting friends and family, and\\neverything else. Avoid selling important items you own on this day\\nand being lonely.\\nSaturday – Dedicated to Saturn or Shani, Saturday is known as\\nShanivaram. It is a day of rest and recovery. It’s a day for service\\nwork and charity. Taking rest on Saturdays is considered good for\\nlongevity. It’s not a good day to begin anything new. It’s a good day\\nto do activities related to housing, farming, meditation, and yoga. Do\\nnot create a fuss and be careful about your health. Avoid barber- and\\nparlor-related activities on Saturdays.\\n\\nTiming of Events and 27 Nakshatras\\nRohini, Uttarashadha, Uttara Bhadrapada, and Uttara Phalguni are\\nfixed constellations, and therefore, favorable asterisms for activities\\nwith long-term, sustained, and permanent effects including:\\n•   Digging wells\\n•   Laying the foundations of homes, commercial establishments,\\ntemples, and even towns and cities\\n•   Planting trees\\n•   Purchasing land and property\\n•   Doing meritorious deeds\\n•   Sowing seeds\\n•   Deity installations\\nRevati, Anuradha, Chitra, and Mrigashirsha are considered gentle\\nand soft Nakshatras, and therefore, auspicious for the following\\nactivities:\\n•   Beginning lessons in new subjects\\n•   Fine arts, including singing, dancing\\n•   Making new friendships and partnerships\\n•   For sensual pleasures, including sexual union\\n•   Wearing new clothes\\n•   Taking out processions\\n•   Conducting auspicious ceremonies\\n•   Festivities\\n•   To undertake journeys\\n•   For agricultural activities\\nHasta, Pushya, and Ashwini Nakshatras are considered to be light\\nand swift, and so are good for the following activities:\\n•   Sports and exercises\\n•   Enjoying luxurious items\\n•   Starting new industries\\n•   Skilled labor-related jobs\\n•   Medical treatments\\n•   For starting education and journeys\\n\\n•   Seeing and meeting friends\\n•   Buying and selling\\n•   To perform spiritual activities\\n•   Fine arts-related activities\\n•   Giving and receiving loans\\nSatabhisha, Swati, Punarvasu, Shravana, and Dhanishta are\\nmovable and quick asterisms, and therefore, suitable for the\\nfollowing activities of a temporary nature:\\n•   Undertaking journeys and travels\\n•   Buying vehicles\\n•   Gardening\\n•   Processions\\n•   Visiting friends\\nPurva Bhadrapada, Purvashada, Purva Phalguni, and Bharani are\\ncruel and fierce Nakshatras. They are good for indulging in acts of\\ndeceit and evil, including:\\n•   Conflicts and battles\\n•   Destructions of rivals and enemies\\n•   Incarceration\\n•   Poisoning\\n•   Arson\\n•   Activities of ill-repute\\nVishakha and Krittika are mixed Nakshatras and suitable for routine\\nactivities, including those related to your home and office.\\n\\nHow to Find an Auspicious Muhurta\\nThere are some very broad guidelines you can use to find an\\nauspicious time on your own. Here is a brief explanation. You can\\nsee any Panchang and check for these details.\\nThithis – Avoid Chaturdashi (fourteenth day), Dwadashi (the twelfth\\nday, but some days are fine), Navami (the ninth day), Ashtami (the\\neighth day), Shasti (the sixth day), and Chaturthi (the fourth day)\\nVaras – Monday (Somavaram), Wednesday (Bhuddhavaram),\\nThursday (Guruvaram), and Friday (Shukravaram) are the best,\\nwhile Tuesday (Mangalavaram), Saturday (Shanivaram), and\\nSunday (Adivaram) are to be avoided.\\nNakshatras – Those with a downward-looking direction should be\\navoided. These asterisms, including Bharani, Krittika, Ashlesha,\\nMagha, Purva Phalguni, Vishakha, Moola, Purvashada, and Purva\\nBhadrapada, are to be avoided while fixing Muhurtas.\\nYogas – There are 27 different Panchanga Yogas defined in Vedic\\nAstrology. The ones to be avoided for auspicious occasions are\\nVishakumbha, Shoola, Atigandam, Gandam, Vaidhruti, Vyatipaatam,\\nVajram, Parigham, and Vyaghaatam.\\nKarana – This stands for half lunar days, and there are eleven of\\nthem defined in the Hindu Panchanga System. The ones to avoid for\\nauspicious occasions are Chatuspadam, Vishti, Kimstughnam,\\nShakunam, and Nagam.\\nNote that the elements discussed in Chapter 2, which deal with the\\nnature, direction, and other elements of a Nakshatra, are employed\\nto arrive at fixing Muhurtas for auspicious events.\\n\\nChapter 10: The K.P. System of Stellar Astrology\\nThis bonus chapter introduces you to a new system of Astrology\\nknown as K.P. Astrology. Although derived from Vedic Astrology, the\\nK P System is focused on the use of Nakshatras and their Cuspal\\nLords. Read on to find out more about this intriguing system of\\nNakshatra-based Vedic Astrology.\\nThe K. P. System of Stellar Astrology got its name from its inventor,\\nProfessor Kuthur Subbarayaiyyer Krishnamurthi, who lived from\\n1908 to 1972. He developed this new technique of making\\nastrological predictions, which are based on the sub-lords. The K.P.\\nSystem is based on the Stellar System of predictions.\\nThe stellar astrology system was significantly researched by Shri\\nGopalakrishna Rao (famously known as Meena I) and N. V. Raghava\\nChary (known as Meena II). This system subdivides the 27\\nNakshatras into 243 parts to indicate something called the asterisms’\\nKaalamsa positions. Professor Krishnamurthi knew both these\\nstalwarts intimately.\\nHe extended the theory after working on it for numerous years and\\nbrought in further divisions. According to Professor Krishnamurthi,\\nthe twelve bhavas or houses or lordship positions are subdivided into\\n249 positions of sub-lord. He employed the unequal proportion of the\\nVimshottari Dasa System to create these subdivisions.\\nIt is important to note that Professor Krishnamurti did not go against\\nthe grain of the traditional form of Vedic Astrology. In fact, he\\nemphasizes the importance of getting the fundamentals of the\\nancient system perfectly right before venturing into the K. P. System\\nof Stellar Astrology. Some deviations from the traditional Vedic\\nAstrology system have been taken by the founders of K. P. System,\\nsummarized as follows.\\nTo reiterate, there are twelve Zodiac Signs (or Rashis) and twelve\\nBhaavs or houses in the 360-degree elliptic, according to the\\ntraditional Jyotishya. Moreover, the 27 Nakshatras or asterisms are\\nconnected to the twelve Rashis and houses, with each star getting\\n13 degrees, 20 minutes in the elliptic. Therefore, every house gets\\n\\ntwo and a quarter stars, which means that parts of Nakshatra(s)\\nspillover from or into the previous or next Sign or House.\\n\\nDeviations from Vedic Astrology\\nThe Vedic system is based on the equal house concept, which is the\\nstarting point of the deviations in the K. P. System. The K. P. System\\nuses the Placidus System of dividing the Twelve Houses wherein\\neach Cusp of the Twelve Houses—or the beginning of each house—\\nis treated differently and has unique measurements.\\nThe  houses’ Cusps considered important factors that play a big role\\nin a native’s life and life experiences. The measurement of a house\\ncould be less than the exact 30 degrees as proposed in Vedic\\nAstrology. Therefore, the Cusp of that particular house will be limited.\\nIn fact, in some cases, the Cusp may be entirely missing, and in\\nother cases, two signs might have the same Cusp.\\nHere is an analogy to explain why further divisions within each star’s\\nspan to create subdivisions, each with a sub-lord, were needed.\\nSuppose you have a stick that you use as a measuring tool, and you\\ndivide and make equal or unequal finite sections on this stick to\\nrecord the measurements. When you start using this tool, you realize\\nthat some hitherto hidden objects or elements are falling between\\nthe markings or sections, which can give erroneous measurements.\\nTherefore, you have to make finer subsections of each section to\\nconsider the impediments to accurate measurements.\\nThe first sub-division of the span of a star is called Sub. These Subs\\nare again divided into even finer portions referred to as Sub-Sub.\\nThe short form is SSL. The next level of sub-divisions is called SS4,\\nand then SS5, and so forth. To measure these Subs and SSLs,\\nProfessor Krishnamurthi again used the Dasha system’s accepted\\nVedic form, namely the Vimshottari Dasha System.\\nAccording to this ancient, traditional system, each of the nine planets\\nconsidered in Vedic Astrology has a fixed number of years, during\\nwhich its Dasha will be played. Each star’s span is divided into nine\\nparts, which become the primary Sub-Division. Until now, he\\nfollowed the Vedic system. Now, he further sub-divided each of these\\nnine parts and obtained one-ninth of a part called Sub-Sub. These\\nsub-divisions are crucial contributing factors for increasing the\\naccuracy of predictions.\\n\\nNow, a transiting planet is variable because it is continuously\\nmoving. The other considerations are Sign-Lord and Star-Lord. The\\nmoving planet will occupy one of the nine sub-parts in the star, ruled\\nby one of the nine planets. Therefore, each Sub has a Sub-Lord.\\nWhen the divisions get finer, there are Sub-Subs, each of which will\\nhave a Sub-Sub-Lord, and so forth.\\nThe transiting planet becomes a source of an event. The lord of the\\nstar, the sub-lord, the sub-sub-lord, and the lord of the Sign, through\\nwhich the planet is transiting, will decide the course of events as\\nindicated by the house. It is important to note that the Twelve Cusps\\nare given the same importance as the planets. Now, every Cusp will\\nhave a Cusp-Lord, Star-Lord, and Sub-Lord. Note that the Cusp-Lord\\nwill be the Sign-Lord only.\\n\\nBasic Concepts of K. P. System\\nAn asterism has a fixed length, which is 13 degrees, 20 minutes, or\\n800 minutes. Each of these asterisms is further divided into nine\\nparts or divisions. Each of these nine divisions (called sub) is again\\nruled by a planetary lord (called sub-lord). The first ruler is the lord of\\nthe constellation himself, followed by the sequence of the lords,\\naccording to the Vimshottari Dasha System. Each part’s range or\\nspan is determined by the years allotted to the planetary lords in the\\nVimshottari System.\\nTherefore, 800 minutes is taken as 120 years, which means twenty\\nyears is equal to 800 minutes. Therefore, one year is equal to\\n800/120, which is equal to 20/3. The above formula is used to\\ncalculate the spans of the Sub-Lords as follows:\\n•   Ketu rules for seven years in the Vimshottari Dasha System.\\nConverting that using the formula 7 * 20/3), you get 0 degrees,\\n46 minutes, and 40 seconds.\\n•   Venus or Shukra rules for twenty years. His Sub-Lord Range\\nwould be 2 degrees, 13 minutes, and 20 seconds.\\n•   Sun or Surya rules for six years, and therefore, his range\\nwould be 0 degrees, 40 minutes.\\n•   Chandra ruling for ten years would have a sub-lord range of 1\\ndegree, 6 minutes, and 40 seconds.\\n•   Mars or Mangala’s rule is seven years. The range of his sub-\\nlordship is 0 degrees, 46 minutes, and 40 seconds.\\n•   Rahu (eighteen years) has a sub-lordship range of 2 degrees.\\n•   Jupiter or Guru (sixteen years) has a sub-lordship range of 1\\ndegree, 46 minutes, and 40 seconds.\\n•   Saturn of Shani (nineteen years) has a sub-lordship range of\\n2 degrees, 6 minutes, and 40 seconds.\\n•   Mercury or Bhuddh (seventeen years) has a sub-lordship\\nrange of 1 degree, 53 minutes, and 20 seconds\\nTherefore, there are twelve signs, 27 Nakshatras, and 249 Subs.\\nEvery nine Nakshatra trine sequence consists of 83 Subs in this\\nsystem. In the K. P. System, the degrees of Chandra and Rahu subs\\n\\nget divided two times in respect of the three trines, which means\\nthere are six more Subs, taking the final tally to 249.\\nInterestingly, in horary Astrology—an ancient form in which the\\nastrologer seeks to find solutions based on the time—the seeker\\nwho raised the question asks the questioner to choose a number\\nbetween 1 and 249, including both. This number given by the\\nquestioner is taken as the Lagna and the beginning of the first\\nbhaava.\\nAyanamsa is included in the K. P. System calculations and is taken\\nas 50.2388 seconds per year.\\nBirth charts and horary charts are prepared using the Placidus\\nSystem, or the semi-arc system. The arc is measured to calculate\\nthe Sun’s time to rise on a given day at a given latitude. This arc is\\nthen divided into three equal divisions. The reason for using this\\nconcept is that the rising sun’s time places it exactly on the\\nAscendant.\\nAfter that, the Sun transits through the twelfth, eleventh, tenth, etc.,\\nat equal intervals until sunset when it reaches the seventh house or\\nthe Descendant. In this system, the degrees computed like this are\\nthe starting point.\\nSigns are employed to the strength of the planets and planetary\\nlords. A strong planet will give immediate results, whereas a weak\\nplanet takes time to render its effects. Benefic planets in positions of\\ndebilitation will act slowly. However, they will not give bad results.\\nMalefic planets in exaltation positions cannot alter bad results to\\ngood if their effects are bad. A planet’s results are based on its\\noccupation, ownership, and nature.\\nAlso, the planet lord offers results according to the indication given\\nby the Nakshatra Lord in which it is posited. This indicator is more\\npowerful than those given by the house or the planet lord himself. A\\nplanet is predominantly under the influence of the Nakshatra lord.\\nThe K. P. System considers that planets are not naturally benefic or\\nmalefic. Planets in predominantly improving bhavas, including one,\\ntwo, three, six, ten, and eleven, give good results, and in the non-\\nimproving bhavas, namely four, five, seven, eight, nine, and twelve\\ngive bad results. The inherent nature of the planets, however,\\n\\nremains unchanged. Results are experienced only by lords of the\\ndasha, bhukti, and sookshama conjoined together. A Nakshatra\\nlord’s results are modified according to the specifications and\\nindications of that planet’s sub-lord. Therefore, bad bhava\\nsignificators are malefic, and good bhava significators are benefic.\\nIn the same way, it is important not to take any house or Sign to be\\nfully malefic or benefic. For example, the sixth house is an improving\\nbhava. But for what? is the question asked by the seeker. It is an\\nimproving house for getting loans, overdrafts, or service; however,\\nthe sixth house is not good for diseases, marriages, etc. The same\\nlogic holds good for all the houses. One exception to the rule is that\\nany house twelfth to a house has a negating effect on that house.\\n\\nSignificance of Sub-Lords in K. P. System\\nSo, the range of a constellation is 800 minutes, divided into unequal\\ndivisions according to the ruling years allocated to each planet.\\nProfessor Krishnamurthi was the first astrologer to have divided this\\n800-minute range into nine subdivisions, and further divided each of\\nthese sub-divisions into sub-sub-divisions. The Nakshatra is\\nanalogous to the Dasha periods, the bhukti is analogous to the sub-\\ndivisions, and the antardashas are analogous to the Sub-Sub-Lord.\\nThe birth chart can be controlled by the Cusp Sub Lord, who is, in\\nturn, controlled by the Nakshatra lord. This affects the matters\\ndetermined by the Cusp. The matters dealt with in the houses are\\nmodified according to the significations of the cuspal sub lords.\\nTherefore, in the K. P. System, the cuspal sub-lord is the deciding\\nfactor.\\nTherefore, to assess and evaluate questions, the matter in the query\\nshould be seen from the perspective of the particular house’s cuspal\\nsub-lord, which deals with the matter in question. As an example, the\\nseventh house’s Cusp determines the marriage-related matters of\\nthe concerned native. If you need to look at children-related matters\\nfor a native, you must see the cuspal sub-Lord position of the fifth\\nhouse, and so forth. Summarily, in the K. P. System of Stellar\\nAstrology, the Cusp of the house and the cusp’s sub-lord and his\\nsignifications are analyzed to make predictions.\\nAdditionally, multiple houses play a role in the life events of a native.\\nThe K. P. System has grouped the houses that influence life events\\ntogether (like a team) and called them House Groups. The primary\\nhouses and the supporting houses are combined to get the house\\ngrouping for that particular event.\\nFor example, the primary house for good health is the first house,\\nand the supporting house is eleven. Now, the event is promised—in\\nthis case, it means the native will enjoy good health—if the sub-lord\\nof the primary house’s Cusp signifies both the primary and\\nsupporting house. Also, any event’s timing is when the planet lords\\nof the ongoing dasha, including the mahadasha, antardasha, and\\npratyantardasha lords, signify the house group. So, in the example of\\n\\ngood health, a native will enjoy good health when he or she passes\\nthrough the planetary dashas signifying houses one and eleven.\\nIt comes as no surprise that making predictions and reading\\nhoroscopes using the K. P. System of Stellar Astrology is more\\ncomplex than the traditional one, considering that the starting point is\\nthe cuspal sub-lord and cannot fit into a small chapter. But the\\nintrigue, mystery, and fascination for this sub-topic of Vedic Astrology\\ncannot be undermined. This bonus chapter is only to trigger an\\ninterest so that you learn more about it.\\n\\nConclusion\\nYou are likely reeling under the amount of information given in this\\nbook about Nakshatras. The data given here is well-researched and\\ntried and tested for centuries. However, do not be disheartened,\\nbecause the only reason for feeling overwhelmed is that the subject\\nis unfamiliar. Added to that are detailed formulas and mathematical\\ncalculations.\\nReread the chapters slowly, and the second time around, you will\\nsee that it gets easier to follow. Once the wall of difficulty\\nunderstanding the basics of this fascinating subject falls, it is only an\\nupward trend. You will become so absorbed in it that nothing will\\nstop you from devouring other advanced books and master the topic\\nas fast as you can.\\nA word of caution is needed at this point. The book has many\\npractical tips for reading the meaning of Nakshatras and their related\\nelements to understand how they work. It is important to know that\\nby itself, this kind of general information is not complete. Every\\nperson’s Rashi chart and planet transits according to the Dasha\\nsystems are individualistic and unique.\\nTherefore, the information you imbibe from this book must be used in\\nconjunction with the context of individuals’ birth charts and their\\nunique Dashas. In fact, it would be a great idea for you to keep your\\nown Rashi Chart and the Dashas developed from your birth chart\\nready and use it as you learn from this book.\\nYou will be surprised to see how easy you find it to discern the good\\ntimes and the bad times in your life as you see the movement of the\\nplanets through your individual Dasha system under the influence of\\nyour birth Nakshatras and other elements related to it. So, go on,\\nread the book, and this time, keep your own Rashi chart with you.\\n\\nHere’s another book by Mari Silva that you might\\nlike\\nClick here to check out this book!\\n\\nYour Free Gift\\nThanks for downloading this book!

The transit of planets, especially Shani and\\nGuru, plays a crucial role in any important event happening in the\\nlifetime of a native. For example, Shani Mahadasha will have antardashas (sub-periods)\\nwithin its 19-year duration. For instance, Shukra will be an\\nantardasha within the Shani Mahadasha for 2 years and 9 months.\",\n",

These doshas can affect various aspects of a person\\'s life, including health, relationships, and overall well-being. \\n\\nCommon types of lagna dosh include:\\n\\n1. **Lagna Lord in a Malefic House**: If the lord of the lagna is placed in a house that is considered malefic (like the 6th, 8th, or 12th houses), it can create challenges for the native.\\n\\n2. **Afflicted Lagna**: If the lagna itself is aspected or occupied by malefic planets, it can lead to difficulties in the native\\'s life.\\n\\n3. **Weak Lagna**: A lagna that is weak due to the presence of malefic planets or lack of benefic aspects can indicate a lack of vitality or challenges in personal identity.\\n\\n4. **Paaka Lagna Issues**: As mentioned in the documents, paaka lagna represents the physical self. If there are malefic influences on paaka lagna, it may lead to physical ailments or complaints.\\n\\nTo mitigate lagna dosh, remedies such as wearing gemstones, performing specific rituals, or making lifestyle changes may be suggested by astrologers. It\\'s essential to consult a knowledgeable astrologer for a personalized analysis and appropriate remedies based on the entire natal chart.', 'contexts': ['So Chandra lagna should not be ignored. 7.3.3 \\nRavi Lagna (Sun lagna) \\n \\nRavi lagna means Sun taken as a reference. We can find houses from Sun. Because \\nSun is the significator of soul, these houses show things from the perspective of soul. For things related to physical vitality also, Sun is an important reference. 7.3.4 \\nArudha Lagna \\n \\nComputation of arudha lagna (AL) will be explained in the chapter on “Arudha \\nPadas”. For now, the readers should remember that arudha lagna shows how a native \\nis perceived in the world. It also shows the status of a native. A planet in the 10th house from lagna may give some important developments in \\none’s profession. A planet in the 10th house from Chandra lagna may give some \\nimportant mental activity in one’s profession. A planet in the 10th house from arudha \\nlagna may give some important developments in one’s professional status. 7.3.5 \\nPaaka Lagna \\n \\nPaaka lagna is important when analyzing the natal chart, dasas and transits. Paaka \\nlagna is nothing but lagna lord taken as a reference.', 'On the other hand, paaka lagna explicitly stands for the \\nphysical self and a malefic planet transiting in paaka lagna may give bodily \\ncomplaints. Similarly planets occupying or aspecting arudha padas in transit may \\ngive relevant results. For example, Saturn’s transit in A10 can be bad for career, \\nJupiter’s transit in A9 is good for fortune and so on. Example 104: Let us consider the natal chart of a lady and the transit chart at the \\ntime of her wedding (see Chart 53). Part 3: Transit Analysis \\n321\\n \\n \\nChart 53 \\n \\n \\nThe 7th house in the natal chart is in Vi. Mercury is the 7th lord and he is in Cn in \\nnatal chart. Venus is the significator of marriage and he is in Le in the natal chart. 322 \\nVedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach\\nVivaha saham is at 1º in Cp in the natal chart. If important planets influence these \\nreference points in transit, they can give marriage. Jupiter is a natural benefic and also lagna lord here. His transit is important for \\ntiming auspicious events. On the day of wedding, Jupiter occupied Pi, aspecting Vi \\n(natal 7th house) and Cn (has natal 7th lord).', 'If someone with Pisces lagna has \\nJupiter in Cancer, then Cancer becomes paaka lagna. If someone with Leo lagna has \\nSun in Virgo, Virgo becomes paaka lagna. Rasis represent situations and forces influencing the course of a native’s life and \\nplanets represent individual beings. Lagna lord represents the physical self of a \\nnative. So that is what paaka lagna shows. Houses counted from paaka lagna throw \\nlight on matters related to the physical self of a native. 72 \\nVedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach\\nLagna shows the concept of self and it deals with one’s true personality. The \\nphysical existence of the person is different from this conceptual self. This applies to \\nall divisional charts. Let us take an example. The 5th house shows scholarship, \\nmemory and success in competition. All these are related to learning and they are \\nseen in D-24, the chart of learning. But they are better seen from different references. Let us find the best reference for each. Success in competition is related to the illusions and perceptions of the world and so \\nthe most appropriate reference is arudha lagna.'], 'faithfulness': 0.9523809523809523}\n"
